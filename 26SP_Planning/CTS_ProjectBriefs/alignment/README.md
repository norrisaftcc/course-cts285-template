README.md

this folder contains first-order (alignment/files)
and second-order (alignment/context) data for the
26SP Great Alignment task.

the files being worked on are in a parent folder,
in 
GRDCreativeBriefs/ (largely input)

and

CTSCreativeBriefs/ (largely output)

in the most general terms, we're doing 
a gap analysis phase, and then another design
and iteration phase, to fully flesh out the
GRD Briefs into CTS versions that have our needs.
