# Programming Project Brief

## Task/Project Management Platform - Spring 2026 Capstone

-----

## Project Overview

**Platform Name:** Task/Project Management Platform (Core System)

**Project Duration:** 16 weeks (Spring Semester 2026)

**Team Structure:**

- 3-5 Programming students per team
- 1 Database student (support role) per team
- Scrum methodology

**Deliverable:** Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - A functional task and project management platform with core features operational

-----

## The Challenge

Build a **flexible, white-label task management platform** that can serve multiple distinct markets through customized branding and configuration. Your platform will be the universal technical foundation that powers task management solutions for families, students, freelancers, event planners, construction workers, and corporate teams.

**Think of it this way:** Shopify is one e-commerce platform that serves jewelry makers, clothing brands, and software companies. Your platform does the same thing for task management—one technical solution, multiple market applications.

-----

## White-Label Market Applications

Design students will be creating market-specific branding campaigns for these six applications of your platform:

### 1. FamilyHub - Family Task Coordinator

**Target Users:** Parents managing household responsibilities  
**Use Case:** Coordinate chores, appointments, family schedules, and shared to-do lists  
**Physical Product:** Magnetic command center board with NFC task cards

### 2. StudyStream - Student Assignment Planner

**Target Users:** College students balancing coursework and work  
**Use Case:** Track assignments, deadlines, group projects, and study schedules  
**Physical Product:** Desk organizer with integrated timer/alarm

### 3. FreelanceFlow - Freelance Project Manager

**Target Users:** Independent contractors juggling multiple clients  
**Use Case:** Manage client projects, deliverables, invoices, and time tracking  
**Physical Product:** Invoice kit with branded stamps and templates

### 4. EventPro - Event Planning System

**Target Users:** Wedding and event planners  
**Use Case:** Coordinate vendors, timelines, budgets, and event checklists  
**Physical Product:** Planning kit with timeline cards and stickers

### 5. RenovateRight - Home Project Tracker

**Target Users:** Homeowners managing renovation projects  
**Use Case:** Track contractors, budgets, materials, and project milestones  
**Physical Product:** Project binder with measuring tools and tracking sheets

### 6. TeamFlow™ - Agile Productivity Orchestrator (Satirical)

**Target Users:** Corporate teams (with dystopian productivity tracking twist)  
**Use Case:** Sprint planning, velocity tracking, “optimization” metrics  
**Physical Product:** Physical scrum board with RFID task cards

-----

## Why This Matters

**Universal Features Are Your Goal:**

- A “task” works the same whether it’s a chore, an assignment, a deliverable, or a vendor call
- Project organization applies to family members, clients, event venues, or construction rooms
- Due dates, priorities, and status tracking are universal needs

**Market-Specific Terminology Can Vary:**

- Tasks → Chores (family), Assignments (students), Deliverables (freelance), Action Items (events), Jobs (renovation)
- Projects → Family Members (family), Classes (students), Clients (freelance), Events (planning), Rooms (renovation)

**Your Technical Challenge:**
Build a platform flexible enough that ONE codebase serves all six markets with minimal modification—just configuration and theming changes.

## Collaboration with Design Students

**Overview:**
Graphic design students are creating complete brand campaigns for the six white-label applications of your platform. They work individually (not in teams) and complete their projects in 8 weeks.

### Week 1-2: Joint Kickoff

- Meet design students assigned to your platform
- Present your technical approach and planned features
- Participate in collaborative brainstorming about user needs across different markets
- Establish communication channels

### Weeks 2-8: Ongoing Communication

Design students may contact you with questions:

- Feature capabilities and constraints
- Technical feasibility of ideas
- Platform functionality for their specific market

**This helps both groups:**

- They learn about technical constraints
- You learn about user needs in different markets
- Their questions may reveal features you hadn’t considered

### Week 8: Design Delivery

Design students present their completed campaigns and deliver:

- Logo files and brand guidelines
- Color schemes and typography specifications
- Style guides for brand application
- Marketing materials showing market positioning

**What you can do with this (optional but recommended):**

- Implement one brand theme to demonstrate white-label capability
- Use their materials in your final presentation
- Show how one technical platform serves multiple markets

-----

## Professional Development Goals

Beyond technical skills, this project teaches:

**Systems Thinking:** Building platforms, not point solutions  
**User-Centered Design:** Understanding that different users have different needs  
**Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Working with designers who think differently than developers  
**Trade-Off Management:** Prioritizing ruthlessly within time constraints  
**Market Awareness:** Technical capability alone doesn’t create value—it must solve real problems

-----

## Questions to Guide Your Development

1. What makes this more useful than a spreadsheet?
1. How do you balance power/flexibility with simplicity/ease-of-use?
1. What’s the minimum information needed to make a task actionable?
1. How does your platform scale when a user creates 1000+ tasks?
1. What happens when features conflict? (e.g., “simple” vs. “powerful”)
1. How do you help users actually complete tasks, not just track them?
1. What would make YOUR platform the one you’d choose to use?

## Final Notes

You’re building something that could genuinely be useful. The best capstone projects are ones where the team thinks “we should actually keep working on this.”

Focus on:

- **Core functionality that works reliably**
- **Clean, maintainable code**
- **Thoughtful architecture that allows flexibility**
- **Understanding WHY certain features matter to users**

One technical solution. Multiple markets. That’s the power of platform thinking.

**Build it well.**
