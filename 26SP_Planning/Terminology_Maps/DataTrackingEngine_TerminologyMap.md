# Data Tracking Engine Terminology Configuration

## White-Label Architecture - Spring 2026

**Status:** BLOCKED - Awaiting GRD Creative Briefs from GRAY (See Issue #7)

## Overview

The Data Tracking Engine collects and visualizes personal metrics over time—fitness data, health metrics, habits, environmental data, and other quantified-self measurements. Currently, no GRD Creative Briefs have been provided for this engine.

## Expected White-Label Skins

Based on CTS planning documents, the following skins are anticipated:

| Skin | Target Market | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| FitTrack | Fitness enthusiasts | Exercise, steps, workouts |
| HealthHub | Health-conscious users | Vitals, medication, symptoms |
| HabitLoop | Self-improvement seekers | Habit streaks, daily routines |
| HomeMetrics | Smart home users | Energy, temperature, environment |
| **MoodSync™** | AlgoCratic satire | Emotional compliance monitoring |

---

## Placeholder Core Entity Terms

| Generic Term | Genuine Skins | Satirical Skin |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Metric | Stat / Measurement | Compliance Indicator |
| Entry | Log / Record | Submitted Data Point |
| Trend | Progress / History | Alignment Trajectory |
| Goal | Target / Milestone | Optimization Objective |
| Alert | Reminder / Notification | Deviation Warning |

---

## Data Types Expected

| Data Category | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Biometric | Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, sleep |
| Activity | Steps, exercise, calories, distance |
| Behavioral | Habits, mood, productivity, screen time |
| Environmental | Temperature, humidity, air quality |

## Next Steps

1. **GRAY Input Required:** Design team needs to provide 2-3 creative briefs
   - At least one genuine market product
   - One satirical variant (MoodSync™)

2. **Once Received:**
   - Complete terminology mapping
   - Create Aligned brief documents
   - Finalize configuration YAML examples
