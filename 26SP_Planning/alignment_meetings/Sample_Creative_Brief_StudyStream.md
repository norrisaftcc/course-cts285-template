# Creative Brief: StudyStream
## Task Management Platform | White-Label Application

**Brief Version:** 1.0  
**Platform Team:** Task Management (CSC 289)  
**Target Completion:** Week 8 (brand assets to dev team)

---

## Product Overview

**StudyStream** is a task and project management application designed for college students. It helps users track assignments, collaborate on group projects, and manage deadlines across multiple courses.

The platform shares its technical foundation with five other white-label products. Your brand design will be applied to this shared foundation, giving it a unique identity that resonates with student users.

## Target Audience

### Primary User Profile
- **Age:** 18-25
- **Context:** Full-time college/university students
- **Tech Comfort:** High - grew up with smartphones
- **Pain Points:** Juggling multiple courses, group project chaos, procrastination guilt

### User Scenarios
1. **Sarah, sophomore:** Uses StudyStream to track assignments across 5 classes. Loves the deadline view.
2. **Dev team (Marcus, Jaylen, Priya):** Share a workspace for their software engineering project. Need to see who's doing what.
3. **Alex, senior:** Uses it as a thesis tracker with milestone breakdowns.

### Emotional Context
- **When opening the app:** "What do I need to do today?" (slight anxiety)
- **While using:** "I've got this organized" (growing confidence)
- **After completing tasks:** "I'm actually on top of things" (satisfaction, dopamine)

## Brand Positioning

### The Big Idea
*"Your semester, organized."*

StudyStream isn't just another to-do app—it's the feeling of having your academic life under control without the stress.

### Tone of Voice
- **Encouraging** - Not preachy or parent-like
- **Casual professional** - Friendly but not immature
- **Action-oriented** - Focuses on what you'll accomplish
- **Low-pressure** - Never guilt-trips about incomplete tasks

### Sample Voice Examples
✅ "Nice! 3 tasks completed today."  
✅ "Your group project deadline is in 2 days. You've got this."  
❌ "You have 12 overdue tasks." (too anxiety-inducing)  
❌ "Great job, champ!" (too patronizing)

### Competitive Landscape
- **Notion** - Powerful but overwhelming for simple task tracking
- **Todoist** - Clean but not student-specific
- **Google Tasks** - Too minimal, no collaboration
- **Paper planners** - Surprising competitor; some students prefer analog

**StudyStream differentiator:** Built for the rhythms of academic life (semesters, courses, group work).

## Visual Direction Guidelines

### Suggested Mood
- Modern but warm
- Clean without being sterile
- Energetic without being overwhelming
- "Coffee shop study vibes"

### Color Considerations
- Consider colors that reduce cognitive load (avoid harsh contrasts during long study sessions)
- Think about light/dark mode from the start
- Colors should work at 3am during a late-night study session

### Typography Considerations
- Highly readable at small sizes (mobile-first)
- Distinct hierarchy between task titles and details
- Consider dyslexia-friendly options

### Imagery/Iconography
- Simple, line-based icons preferred (faster recognition)
- Avoid literal "books and backpacks" student clichés
- Consider abstract representations of progress/flow
