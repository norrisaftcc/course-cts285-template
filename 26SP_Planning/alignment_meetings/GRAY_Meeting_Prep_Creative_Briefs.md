# GRAY Meeting Prep: Creative Briefs & Project Categories
**Purpose:** Prep materials for discussion with GRD instructor about white-labeling briefs  
**Time Needed:** ~1 hour conversation  
**Status:** Ready for discussion

---

## TL;DR FOR THE CONVERSATION

You're giving GRAY everything they need to create/distribute **24 creative briefs** (4 platforms × 6 white-labels each) to their design students. Each designer picks one white-label and creates a brand campaign for it.

---

## THE FOUR PROJECT CATEGORIES (PLATFORMS)

| Platform | What Dev Teams Build | What Designers Brand |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Task Management** | Multi-tenant workspace system | 6 product skins (family, student, freelance, events, home reno, AlgoCratic) |
| **2. E-Commerce** | Online storefront engine | 6 product skins (candles, fashion, electronics, pets, plants, AlgoCratic) |
| **3. Recommendation Engine** | Preference-matching system | 6 product skins (books, restaurants, cars, streaming, recipes, AlgoCratic) |
| **4. Health Tracker** | Wellness data platform | 6 product skins (fitness, heart health, pets, mental wellness, nutrition, AlgoCratic) |

**Key insight for GRAY:** All 6 white-labels for a platform share the SAME technical foundation. Designers are creating visual/brand differentiation, not functional differentiation.

## TASK MANAGEMENT PLATFORM - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

Since this is the first one being briefed, here are the 6 white-labels:

| White-Label | Target Market | Core Use Case | Tone/Vibe |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **FamilyHub** | Parents/households | Chores, appointments, family coordination | Warm, organized, slightly chaotic (in a loving way) |
| **StudyStream** | College students | Assignments, deadlines, group projects | Energetic, productivity-focused, peer-driven |
| **FreelanceFlow** | Independent contractors | Client projects, deliverables, time tracking | Professional, sleek, empowering |
| **EventPro** | Event planners | Vendor coordination, timelines, budgets | Glamorous, high-stakes, celebratory |
| **RenovateRight** | Homeowners | Contractor management, project milestones | Practical, trustworthy, before-and-after vibes |
| **TeamFlow™** | Corporate teams | Sprint planning, velocity tracking | ***SATIRICAL*** - dystopian surveillance aesthetic |

### Physical Product Tie-Ins (Design Stretch Goal?)

Each white-label has a physical product concept. **Question for GRAY:** Is this in-scope for design students?

- FamilyHub → Magnetic command center with NFC task cards
- StudyStream → Desk organizer with integrated timer  
- FreelanceFlow → Invoice kit with branded templates
- EventPro → Planning kit with timeline cards
- RenovateRight → Project binder with tracking sheets
- TeamFlow™ → Physical scrum board with RFID cards

## CREATIVE BRIEF TEMPLATE (PROPOSED)

For GRAY to adapt/distribute to design students:

```markdown
# Creative Brief: [WHITE-LABEL NAME]
## Platform: [e.g., Task Management]

### The Product
[One-paragraph description of what this app does]

### Target Audience
- **Primary User:** [Demographics, psychographics]
- **Context of Use:** [When/where/why they use this]
- **Emotional State:** [How they feel when using it]

### Brand Positioning
- **Tagline:** [Suggested or TBD by designer]
- **Tone of Voice:** [3-5 adjectives]
- **Competitive Landscape:** [Real-world analogues]

### Required Deliverables
1. Logo + wordmark
2. Color palette (primary, secondary, accents)
3. Typography selection (headings, body)
4. Sample UI mockup (one key screen)
5. [Optional] Physical product concept

### Design Constraints
- Must work at small sizes (app icon, favicon)
- Must be accessible (WCAG contrast considerations)
- Must support light/dark modes
- CSS variables preferred for implementation

### The Platform Connection
This design will be applied to a shared technical platform built by CSC 289 students. Your brand assets will be implemented by developers. Expect:
- A hand-off meeting in Week 8
- Questions about how your brand translates to code
- A working demo using your brand by Week 12

### AlgoCratic Context (if satirical variant)
[For TeamFlow™, ComplianceCart™, etc.]
This is the satirical white-label. The aesthetic should feel:
- Slightly unsettling corporate cheerfulness
- "We're watching you for your benefit"
- Surveillance capitalism with a smile
```

## QUESTIONS FOR GRAY (FROM UNCERTAINTY MATRIX)

These were flagged as needing answers:

1. **Design deliverable format:** Is there a standard format/template for brand asset delivery that your students use?

2. **Design timeline flexibility:** Week 8 handoff is based on your 8-week project. Is that accurate? Any flexibility?

3. **White-label assignment:** Do individual designers choose which white-label to brand, or are they assigned?

4. **Satirical comfort:** Are all design students comfortable with the AlgoCratic satirical elements? Should we make the satirical white-label optional?

5. **Physical products:** The briefs mention physical product tie-ins. Is that part of design scope, or just conceptual?

6. **Portfolio rights:** Any concerns about students using collaborative work in portfolios?

---

## AGENDA SUGGESTION FOR THE MEETING

**0-5 min:** Quick orientation to the 4 platforms  
**5-15 min:** Deep-dive on Task Management as example  
**15-25 min:** Walk through creative brief template  
**25-35 min:** Address the 6 questions above  
**35-45 min:** Discuss satirical white-labels specifically  
**45-55 min:** Agree on next steps and timeline  
**55-60 min:** Any remaining questions

---

## DECISION POINTS TO RESOLVE

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Brief ownership | GRAY creates all / You create all / Split | GRAY creates from your template |
| Satirical opt-out | Required / Optional / Assigned | Make optional, count as extra credit |
| Physical products | In-scope / Conceptual only / Bonus | Conceptual only (stretch goal) |
| Assignment method | Student choice / Assigned / First-come | Student choice with fallback to random |

## FILES TO SHARE WITH GRAY

1. `26SP_Platform_Project_Matrix.md` - The full platform breakdown
2. `26SP_Cross_Discipline_Protocol.md` - The collaboration framework
3. This meeting prep document (or a refined version)
4. Any existing TaskManager creative brief WIP

---

## THE "DYNAMIC TENSION" RESOLVED

From your initial prompt about "Here to Help" vs "Satirizing workplace challenges":

**For the creative briefs, the resolution is:**
- 5 out of 6 white-labels per platform are **genuine, professional brands**
- 1 out of 6 is the **satirical AlgoCratic variant**
- Designers choose which they want to work on
- The satirical one is optional/extra credit if anyone's uncomfortable

This preserves the immersive world-building while ensuring most students get portfolio-ready professional work.
