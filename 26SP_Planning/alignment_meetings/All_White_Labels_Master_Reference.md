## SUGGESTED ASSIGNMENT APPROACH

**Option A: Free Choice**
- Designers browse all 24 and pick one
- First-come, first-served
- Risk: Popular ones get crowded, others orphaned

**Option B: Platform Assignment, Then Choice**
- Each Design Group assigned to one platform
- Choose from that platform's 6 white-labels
- Ensures even distribution across platforms

**Option C: Random + Swap Period**
- Random assignment
- One week to negotiate swaps
- Guarantees coverage

**Recommendation:** Option B - aligns with Dev Team pairing structure

## SATIRICAL WHITE-LABELS: SPECIAL NOTES

These 4 require designers who are comfortable with the AlgoCratic Futures™ aesthetic:

| Product | Satirical Hook |
|---------|---------------|
| TeamFlow™ | "Scrum, But Make It Surveillance" |
| ComplianceCart™ | "Mandatory Purchase Optimization" |
| PreferenceOptimizer™ | "Your Choices, Optimized for Alignment" |
| BiometricCompliance™ | "Your Body, Optimized for Productivity" |

**Visual Direction for Satirical:**
- Unsettlingly cheerful corporate aesthetic
- Clean, modern, but slightly oppressive
- Think: Apple's design language if Big Brother ran it
- Color scheme: Often muted with alarming accent colors

**Opt-Out Recommendation:** Make satirical white-labels optional. Students who aren't comfortable with the dystopian framing can choose from the other 5 in their platform.
