# CREATIVE BRIEF: STREAMPIX

**Platform:** Recommendation Engine (Preference-Learning System)  
**White-Label Application:** Movie/Show Recommendations + Watchlist Tracker  
**Target Market:** Viewers tired of scrolling paralysis and algorithm repetition

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **StreamPix**, a streaming recommendation platform that ends the scroll and gets you watching in under 2 minutes. Unlike Netflix’s algorithm showing the same titles repeatedly or spending entire evenings browsing without watching anything, StreamPix remembers why you added shows to your watchlist, helps couples decide together without arguments, and breaks you out of recommendation loops with fresh suggestions based on what you actually love—not what the platform wants to promote.

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines a **preference-learning app** with **physical watchlist tracker cards**. The challenge is designing for streaming viewers (solo, couples, families) who waste 20-45 minutes scrolling across multiple platforms, forget why they saved shows, and feel trapped by algorithms that show the same content repeatedly.

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 24-40 | Income $35K-$70K | Urban/suburban renters and first-time homeowners | Single, coupled, or young families | Subscribe to 3-5 streaming services

**Viewing Behavior:** Watch streaming content 4-7 nights per week | Binge-watchers and casual viewers | Subscribe to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Prime Video (various combinations) | Save shows to watchlists constantly | Ask friends “What are you watching?” | Follow TV/movie accounts on social media

**Pain Points:**

- Spend 20-45 minutes scrolling through streaming apps, end up watching nothing or rewatching The Office again
- Couple’s “What should we watch?” becomes 30-minute argument ending in frustration
- Add shows to watchlist, forget why they seemed interesting, never watch them
- Netflix/Hulu algorithms show same 20 titles on home screen repeatedly
- Can’t remember which streaming service has which show
- See trailer that looks good, forget to add it anywhere, lose it forever
- Algorithm recommendations feel manipulative (platform pushing their originals, not what you’d actually like)
- Scroll past 200 options, can’t decide, decision fatigue wins
- Partner vetoes every suggestion, no system for finding mutual interest
- Forget which episodes you’ve watched when returning to a series

**Current Behavior:**

- Screenshot show titles from Instagram/TikTok, never look at them again
- Add everything to Netflix watchlist, list becomes 100+ titles with no organization
- Text friends “What should I watch tonight?” and wait for responses
- Google “best shows on [platform]” every single night
- Start three different shows in one evening, finish none
- Default to comfort rewatch (The Office, Friends, Parks & Rec) because deciding is exhausting
- Argue with partner about what to watch, give up, scroll phones separately
- Jump between streaming apps looking for “something good”

**What They Want:**

- Decide what to watch in under 2 minutes, not 30+ minutes
- Remember why they added shows to watchlist (trailer looked good? friend recommended? awards buzz?)
- Stop seeing same Netflix suggestions every single day
- Couple decision-making that doesn’t end in argument
- Discover shows outside algorithm bubble
- One place to track watchlist across all streaming platforms
- Actually use their subscription services (stop wasting money on unwatched content)

### Company Background: Founder Story

Jen and Marcus had the same fight every Friday night. “What should we watch?” One would suggest something. The other would scroll past it. “Nah.” Suggest something else. “We tried that, remember? You didn’t like it.” Scroll scroll scroll. Thirty minutes later, both frustrated, they’d give up and watch The Office again—not because they wanted to, but because deciding felt impossible.

The problem wasn’t lack of options. They subscribed to five streaming services. The problem was the scroll trap. Netflix showed them the same 20 titles every time they opened the app. They’d added 80+ shows to their watchlist but couldn’t remember why half of them seemed interesting. When friends texted “You have to watch [show]!” they’d screenshot it, then forget. The algorithm kept pushing Netflix Originals they had zero interest in.

One night, Jen made physical cards—index cards with show titles, who recommended it, why it sounded good, which service had it. When Friday came, they pulled out the cards, each picked three they were interested in, found the overlap in 2 minutes. Done. Decided. Watching.

Friends came over, saw the card system, wanted it. Then their entire book club wanted it. Then Marcus’s coworkers.

*“You’re not going to suddenly have fewer options. You need a system that helps you decide without the scroll trap.”*

StreamPix became that system—an app that learns what you love and breaks algorithm bubbles, plus physical watchlist cards that make couple decisions easy and remember why something was worth watching in the first place.

### Brand Positioning

**For** streaming viewers ages 24-40 earning $35K-$70K who waste time scrolling and struggle to decide what to watch (especially couples), **StreamPix** is a streaming recommendation system **that** ends the scroll and gets you watching in under 2 minutes by remembering why you saved shows, helping couples decide together, and breaking algorithm loops with fresh suggestions. **Unlike** Netflix/Hulu algorithms that show the same titles repeatedly and push platform originals, **StreamPix** tracks your watchlist across all services, remembers context for why shows interested you, and recommends based on what you actually love—not what algorithms want you to watch.

### Key Brand Messages

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What StreamPix Is

A streaming recommendation platform that tracks your watchlist across all services, remembers why you wanted to watch something, helps couples find mutual interests quickly, and breaks algorithm loops by suggesting shows based on what you actually love—not what platforms want to promote. Unlike streaming service algorithms or endless scrolling, StreamPix focuses on getting you watching in under 2 minutes with decisions based on your current mood and actual preferences.

### How Physical + Digital Work Together

**Initial Setup:**

- **Remote arrives:** Pair with TV and streaming devices (one-time setup via app guidance)
- **App setup:** Download StreamPix app, create household account
- **Profile creation:** Set up family members (Dad, Mom, Kid 1 age 8, Kid 2 age 10) | Connect streaming service logins | Set age restrictions
- **Remote configuration:** Assign profile quick-select buttons (Button 1 = Dad, Button 2 = Mom, etc.)

**Solo Viewing (Tuesday Night - Mom Alone):**

- **Mom picks up remote:** Presses “Who’s Watching?” button

- **TV shows profile selector:** Dad taps Button 1 (Dad) + Button 2 (Mom)
- **Couple mode activated:** “Dad + Mom watching together”
- **Presses “What Should We Watch?”:** TV displays 3 suggestions both will enjoy
- **App reasoning:** “You both loved Succession—try The White Lotus” | Shows: both added to watchlist, 96% match for both profiles
- **Navigate together:** Discuss options visible on shared screen (no separate phone scrolling)
- **Select show:** Launches into Max, starts playing
- **Automatic tracking:** Logs to both Dad and Mom’s profiles as “watched together”

**Family Viewing (Saturday 7pm - Family Movie Night):**

- **Kids pick up remote:** Press “Who’s Watching?” button
- **Select all profiles:** Tap Button 1, 2, 3, 4 (whole family)
- **Family mode activated:** TV shows “Family Movie Night! Here are age-appropriate picks everyone will enjoy”

- **Kid 1:** “We should watch that!”
- **Dad presses “Add to Watchlist” button on remote**
- **TV shows confirmation:** “Added to Family Watchlist”
- **Tagged automatically:** Available on Disney+, appropriate for all profiles, saved for later

**Pattern Learning Over Time (App Intelligence):**

- After 4 weeks: App notices Dad watches action movies solo on Saturday afternoons
- App notices Family does movie night Friday 7pm consistently
- App notices Mom binges true crime Sunday nights after kids’ bedtime
- App notices Dad + Kid 1 watch cartoons together Saturday mornings
- **Next Friday 6:45pm:** App sends notification to TV: “Family movie night in 15 minutes—tonight’s top picks ready when you are”
- **Press remote button:** Pre-loaded suggestions based on pattern recognition

**Cross-Service Intelligence:**

- Family watchlist has show from 5 different services (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Prime)
- App knows: this show on Netflix, that movie on Max, kids’ show on Disney+
- Remote “What Should We Watch?” shows all options regardless of service
- User selects → remote automatically launches correct streaming service
- No remembering which service has what, no app-switching scrolling

### Why This Works When Others Don’t

**Netflix/Hulu/Max Apps:** Algorithm shows same titles repeatedly, pushes platform originals over quality, can’t track across services, no context for why you added something, solo decision-making only, infinite scroll enables paralysis.

**JustWatch/Reelgood:** Helpful for finding which service has a show but doesn’t solve decision paralysis, no couple mode, no “why you added it” tracking, purely digital (still scrolling), doesn’t learn your taste.

**Letterboxd:** Great for movie tracking but focused on logging not deciding, social performance aspect (public reviews), not designed for “what to watch tonight,” no TV shows, no couple decision-making.

**IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes:** Research tools not decision tools, crowd ratings don’t match your taste, overwhelming data, no watchlist management, no cross-service tracking.

**Notes App Screenshots:** Chaos, no organization, can’t search, forget context, can’t filter by mood or service, screenshots pile up unwatched.

**StreamPix Difference:** Solves the actual problem (deciding quickly) not just information problem (finding where to watch), physical cards break scroll paralysis, couple mode ends arguments, cross-service tracking means one organized watchlist, remembering why you added something means you actually watch it. Gets you from couch to watching in under 2 minutes instead of 30+ minutes of scrolling.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Aisha, 28, Graphic Designer

Single, lives alone, watches streaming 5-6 nights per week. Income ~$42K. Subscribes to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+. Her problem: she adds shows to Netflix watchlist constantly (currently 90+ titles), but when she sits down to watch, she scrolls the entire list and can’t remember why anything seemed interesting. Screenshot folder has 40+ show recommendations from TikTok with zero context. She’ll spend 30 minutes opening all three apps, scrolling, reading descriptions, giving up, rewatching New Girl for the 8th time. Not because she wants comfort rewatch, but because deciding feels impossible when tired from work.

**How StreamPix helps:** When she sees show on TikTok, she adds to StreamPix app with note: “TikTok said funny and relatable, 20-min episodes.” After work, brain fried, she presses “What Should We Watch?” button, answers: solo, 30 minutes available, want to laugh. App shows 3 options from her watchlist with her own notes about why they seemed good. She picks one based on her own past reasoning. Decision in 90 seconds. Cards give her physical option—shuffle “Comedy” cards when phone feels like too much screen time, pick one without apps.

**Design takeaway:** Emphasize speed—“90 seconds to decide” should be measurable/visible in app interface. Show user’s own words back to them (their notes, not algorithm description).

### User Story 2: Marcus & Chen, 32 & 34, Couple

Live together, Friday/Saturday nights are date nights with streaming. Combined income ~$78K. Subscribe to Netflix, Max, Prime. Their problem: every single date night starts with 20-30 minute argument about what to watch. Marcus wants action/thriller, Chen wants character drama. They veto each other’s suggestions repeatedly. Algorithm shows them same stuff they’ve already rejected. They’ve wasted entire evenings arguing, then scrolling separately on phones, never watching together. It’s affecting their relationship—date night stress instead of date night connection.

**How StreamPix helps:** They share StreamPix account with Couple Mode. During the week, each adds shows they’re interested in and tags “would watch together” or “just me.” Friday arrives, they open app’s Couple Mode, see only shows both tagged as interested (filtered to mutual). 8 options instead of 200. They pick one in 2 minutes. Physical cards option: each picks 3 cards from shared deck, lay on coffee table, find overlap visually. Deciding becomes 5-minute collaboration not 30-minute fight. Date night saved.

**Design takeaway:** Couple Mode must be prominent feature—visual design should show two people collaborating, not competing. Physical cards enable side-by-side decision without screen barrier.

### User Story 3: Priya, 26, Marketing Coordinator

Single, binge-watcher, watches 3-4 hours most nights. Income ~$38K. Subscribes to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Prime (too many). Her problem: she’s stuck in algorithm loop. Netflix keeps showing her same true crime docs she’s already watched or rejected 20 times. She wants to discover new genres but algorithm has her pegged. When she tries Hulu, same issue—romantic comedies on repeat because she watched one 6 months ago. She’s bored, wants variety, but doesn’t know where to start outside her usual. Friends recommend shows but she forgets to write them down.

**How StreamPix helps:** Friend texts “You HAVE to watch [Show]!” She adds to StreamPix immediately with note “Sarah rec—she said dark comedy.” App’s Discovery Mode analyzes: she loves character-driven shows with quick pacing, regardless of genre. Suggests sci-fi show (genre she’s never tried) that matches those patterns: “You loved shows with complex characters—this has that in sci-fi setting.” She tries it, loves it, rating tells app she’s open to sci-fi now. Algorithm loop broken. Her taste expands because recommendations serve her curiosity, not platform’s agenda.

**Design takeaway:** Discovery Mode should feel like exploration not algorithm manipulation—emphasize breaking out of loops, trying new genres, expanding taste based on actual patterns (pacing, characters, mood) not just genre matching.

### User Story 4: Jordan, 35, Sales Manager

Married with two young kids (4 & 6). After kids’ bedtime, watches with spouse 3-4 nights weekly. Income ~$64K. Subscribes to Disney+, Netflix, Hulu. Their problem: limited watching time (kids wake up early), so wasting 20 minutes scrolling feels especially painful. They have 90 minutes max before bed, lose 25 minutes to scrolling, only get through one episode of 45-min show. They’ve started the same show three times and forgotten which episode they’re on. Different streaming apps don’t sync watch history well. They want to maximize their limited couple time, not waste it browsing.

**How StreamPix helps:** App tracks watch history across all services—“You’re on Season 1 Episode 4 of [Show], continue?” No searching which app, which episode. Their watchlist is pre-filtered: shows under 45 min per episode (fits their time window), both tagged as interested, appropriate for late-night brain-fog watching. Kids go to bed at 8:30, they open app at 8:35, press “What Should We Watch?”, answer “together, 90 minutes, need something light,” app shows 3 options that fit parameters. Pick one, watching by 8:40. Full 85 minutes of actual watching instead of 60 minutes watching after 30 minutes scrolling.

**Design takeaway:** Time efficiency must be measurable and visible—show time saved, emphasize getting to watching quickly. Watch history tracking across services is major quality-of-life feature for parents with limited time.

### Digital Deliverable Options (Choose 2, or 1 if Designing Physical Product)

**Physical Product Design: The Custom Universal Remote (Counts as 1 Digital Deliverable)**
Design the actual remote as digital mockup. Dimensions (approximately 6”x2”x0.75”, but explore optimal ergonomics), materials (ABS plastic body, rubberized grip sections, button materials), button layout hierarchy (StreamPix buttons prominent—“What Should We Watch?” largest/different color, “Who’s Watching?” secondary, “Add to Watchlist” tertiary | standard remote buttons—power, volume, D-pad, OK, back, home, playback controls), illuminated buttons (backlight for dark rooms, auto-dim timer), profile quick-select buttons (numbered 1-4, or custom icons?), USB-C charging port location (bottom edge, protected), StreamPix logo placement (subtle integration, not intrusive), ergonomic grip (comfortable for extended holding, easy to pass between people, works for left/right hands). How does industrial design communicate “premium universal remote + smart streaming assistant”? What makes it feel like upgrade from existing remotes? Consider: Existing universal remote reference products (Logitech Harmony, Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV), weight distribution for premium feel, button tactile feedback differentiation, IR emitter + Bluetooth antenna placement, drop resistance from couch height, spill-resistant coating.

**Option 1: Complete App + On-TV Interface Design**
Mobile app key screens: Profile management (create/edit family members, age restrictions, streaming service logins) | Watchlist (organized by profile, by service, by priority) | Viewing analytics dashboard (who watches what, completion rates, subscription value) | Settings (remote pairing, device management, parental controls).

On-TV interface (appears when remote buttons pressed): **Profile Selector** (“Who’s Watching?” screen—visual icons for each family member, multi-select for groups) | **Suggestion Screen** (“What Should We Watch?” display—3 personalized picks with show art, reasoning, streaming service icons, profile-specific or multi-user combined) | **Watchlist View** (browsable on TV, organized by selected profiles) | **Playback Launch** (transition from StreamPix to streaming service app seamlessly).

How make TV interface readable from couch distance (10+ feet)? How show multi-user suggestions clearly (Dad + Mom picks highlighted differently than solo picks)? How handle age-restricted content visibility (blur/hide from kids’ view)? Consider: Large typography for TV viewing, high-contrast colors for accessibility, animation transitions between screens, D-pad navigation optimized (minimal button presses), family-friendly visual language, streaming service logos prominent.

**Option 2: Social Media Campaign (Minimum 6 Posts)**
Platform: Instagram/TikTok, Twitter. Campaign concept: “Scrolling Horror Stories” (relatable 30-min scroll paralysis moments) | “Couple Fight Club” (funny takes on watching arguments) | “Algorithm Jail” (same Netflix suggestions forever). Goal: app downloads, card sales, brand awareness. How create shareable relatable content? Consider: User-generated content (card photos, decision time screenshots), couple testimonials, “scroll time saved” stats, streaming service memes (respectful).

**Option 3: Website Landing Page**
Who’s landing here: frustrated scrollers, couples fighting about watching, people researching streaming tools. What see immediately: founder story (couple who fought every Friday), problem/solution (scroll paralysis → 2-min decisions), product demo (cards + app). Conversion goal: buy cards, download app, email signup? Mobile-first (people researching from couch)? Consider: Interactive “What Should We Watch?” quiz, scroll time calculator, testimonials from couples, “Works with all streaming services” trust badges, card unboxing video.

**Option 4: Email Campaign Series (Minimum 3 Emails)**
Purpose: New user onboarding (welcome + add first 10 shows + make first decision under 2 minutes) | Educational drip (couple mode tutorial, discovery mode benefits, watch history features) | Re-engagement (you haven’t used app in 2 weeks—here’s what you’re missing). How make helpful not annoying? Mobile-first. Consider: Weekly “Top picks from your watchlist based on mood” automated emails, “Leaving soon” alerts, streaming service news relevant to watchlist.

**Option 5: Digital Advertising Campaign (Minimum 6 Ad Variations)**
Where run: YouTube pre-roll (streaming review channels), Instagram/Facebook (targeting streaming service followers), Reddit sponsored (r/television, r/NetflixBestOf), podcast pre-roll (TV recap podcasts). Hook: “Still scrolling?” | “Spent your whole date night browsing?” | “Same Netflix suggestions. Again.” Segment variations: solo viewers, couples, binge-watchers, casual viewers, families. Consider: Video (scrolling paralysis relatability, timer showing decision speed) vs. static, retargeting, seasonal (new year, holidays, summer TV lull).

**Option 6: App Store Presence (Complete Listing)**
iOS/Google Play. What makes download vs. scroll? Screenshots: “What Should We Watch?” button and 3-question decision flow, cross-service watchlist with service icons, couple mode mutual interests, discovery mode with reasoning, watch history sync, quick add from anywhere. Which feature first: most unique (couple mode) or most needed (cross-service watchlist)? App icon, description copy (first 2 lines: “Stop scrolling. Start watching in 2 minutes.”). Consider: “Entertainment” category crowded, differentiate from streaming apps themselves, keywords (watchlist, streaming, couples, what to watch), social proof (time saved stats).

**Option 7: Animated Explainer Video (Storyboard + Key Frames)**
Length: 60 sec for social, 90 for website. Animation style: relatable illustrated characters in scrolling scenario, motion graphics showing decision flow, hybrid with real streaming app screens? Narrative: Problem (couple scrolling for 30 min, frustration) → Solution (StreamPix cards + app—decision in 2 min) → Result (actually watching, enjoying together). Consider: Split-screen (scrolling paralysis vs. StreamPix speed), couple dynamic (relatable), voiceover tone (empathetic friend), ending CTA (download app, get cards, decide in 2 minutes tonight).

### Research Guidance

**Audience Research:**
Search: r/television, r/NetflixBestOf, r/streaming subreddits | #WhatToWatch, #StreamingLife hashtags | Twitter TV threads | Streaming app reviews.

Find: Language about scrolling frustration | Couple fight stories | Algorithm complaints | Watchlist management pain | Decision paralysis patterns | Time wasted browsing.

**Competitive Research:**
Research: Streaming discovery apps (JustWatch, Reelgood) | Social streaming tools (Letterboxd, TV Time) | Built-in streaming watchlists | Entertainment recommendation sites.

Analyze: Visual territory (dark UI, grid layouts—differentiate?) | Features emphasized? | Where do tools fail at decision-making? | What makes users abandon watchlists? | Algorithm recommendation complaints.

**Visual Research:**
Look: Dribbble/Behance (streaming app, watchlist, recommendation engine, entertainment) | Playing card design | Decision-making interfaces | Entertainment app UI | Movie poster design.

Collect: Color palettes (entertainment-focused without being dark/serious) | Typography (friendly, scannable) | Card layouts (maximize info in small space) | Iconography (streaming services, moods, genres) | Photography (real viewing moments).

**Market Research:**
Find statistics: Average streaming subscriptions per household | Time spent browsing vs. watching | Decision fatigue research | Couple relationship research | Streaming retention rates | Cord-cutting trends.

Look: Nielsen streaming data | Streaming service annual reports | Entertainment industry reports | Academic research on choice paralysis | Relationship research | App Annie streaming app usage data.

### Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need from them:**

- Remote hardware specs (IR + Bluetooth compatibility with which devices? Universal learning remote technology? Button count limitations? Battery life with illumination + Bluetooth?)
- HDMI-CEC integration (how does remote monitor playback across devices? Which streaming boxes support this? Privacy/permissions?)
- On-TV interface deployment (Chromecast/AirPlay/Roku channel/smart TV app—which platforms? Development complexity?)
- Multi-user algorithm (how does app filter content for 2+ profiles simultaneously? Age-restriction enforcement? Recommendation weighting when preferences conflict?)
- Streaming service APIs (which services allow login integration? Watch history access? Watchlist sync? Legal/TOS limitations?)
- Profile switching detection (how does remote know when different person picks it up? Manual selection only or automatic?)

**What they need from you:**

- Brand assets (logo with “Pix” styling, color codes, typography for app, on-TV interface, remote branding)
- Remote industrial design specs (dimensions, button layout, materials, LED indicators, ergonomics)
- On-TV interface design (profile selector screen, suggestion display, watchlist view—optimized for 10ft viewing distance, D-pad navigation)
- Mobile app UI specs (profile management, watchlist organization, analytics dashboard, settings, component library)
- Iconography (streaming service logos—licensing?, profile avatars, age ratings, multi-user indicators, suggestion reasoning icons)
- Microcopy (remote button labels, on-TV prompts, profile setup language, suggestion reasoning text, parental control messaging, family-friendly tone throughout)

**How to work together:**
Regular check-ins about technical constraints. Ask early about feasibility (Can remote actually control all streaming devices universally? Can on-TV interface deploy on all platforms or just some? How accurate is watch history tracking? Can multi-user filtering work in real-time? Which streaming APIs are accessible legally?). Share WIP for feedback. Be open to technical limitations (maybe only works with certain streaming boxes, maybe some services don’t allow API access, maybe profile detection requires manual selection). Explain rationale (why “What Should We Watch?” button must be most prominent, why on-TV interface needs 10ft-distance readability, why family mode requires automatic age filtering, why remote must feel premium to justify replacing existing remotes). They’re building universal device control + multi-user intelligence + cross-service integration, you’re designing family harmony + decision speed + premium remote replacement—both essential to ending scroll paralysis for households.

### Final Reminders

This is not fill-in-the-blank work—creativity happens in how you interpret “end the scroll helper.” Streaming apps often look either dark/cinematic (Netflix) or overwhelming grid chaos (Hulu). StreamPix should feel like a friend saying “Just pick one and start watching already!” Your unique value proposition is **custom universal remote with one-button decision-making for individuals, couples, and families—ending scroll paralysis by bringing suggestions to the TV screen where everyone can see and decide together**—not just another app, not physical cards, but actual hardware that replaces remote clutter while solving the “what to watch” problem. Emphasize complete ecosystem: remote controls everything + profiles personalize for everyone + on-TV interface makes decisions collaborative + cross-service intelligence ends platform-hopping. Every design decision needs rationale. This is portfolio-worthy work demonstrating: IoT product design (universal remote hardware), multi-user system design (family profiles + age restrictions), TV UI design (10-foot interface optimization), family-focused brand positioning, replacing existing household products (remotes) with smarter alternative.

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this remote feel premium enough to replace 3-4 existing remotes on the coffee table?
- Does the “What Should We Watch?” button solve decision paralysis or just add a feature?
- Is the on-TV interface readable and navigable from the couch (10+ feet away)?
- Does multi-user mode feel collaborative (family deciding together) not restrictive?
- Would parents trust the age filtering to protect kids automatically?
- Does the industrial design communicate “smart remote” not “cheap universal remote”?
- Would someone actually use this on Friday night when exhausted from work?
