# CREATIVE BRIEF: LET'SEAT!

**Platform:** Recommendation Engine (Preference-Learning System)
**White-Label Application:** Restaurant Discovery + Dining Passport
**Target Market:** Diners struggling with "what to eat?" decision fatigue

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **Let'sEat!**, a restaurant discovery platform that answers the daily question "What do I want to eat?" by learning your preferences and eliminating decision paralysis. Unlike Yelp reviews from strangers or algorithm-driven apps pushing paid placements, Let'sEat! remembers where you've eaten, what you loved, and suggests your next meal based on patterns in your actual dining behavior—not sponsored content.

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines a **preference-learning app** with a **physical dining passport booklet**. The challenge is designing for people across all dining situations (solo, date night, family, business lunch) who waste time scrolling delivery apps, can't decide where to eat, and forget great restaurants they've tried.

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 25-45 | Income $35K-$75K | Urban/suburban | Mix of renters and homeowners | Range from entry-level to mid-career professionals

**Dining Behavior:** Eat out or order delivery 3-8 times per week | Mix of quick lunches, date nights, grabbing dinner, weekend brunch | Use delivery apps regularly (DoorDash, Uber Eats) | Follow food accounts on Instagram/TikTok | Ask friends "where should we eat?" constantly

**Pain Points:**

- Spend 20+ minutes scrolling delivery apps, can't decide, end up at same three places
- "What do you want to eat?" / "I don't know, what do you want?" endless loop with partners
- Yelp reviews feel fake or unreliable (5 stars from bots, 1-star revenge reviews)
- Instagram food looks amazing but can't remember restaurant names later
- Try a great restaurant, forget about it, never return
- Can't remember if they've been somewhere before or if they liked it
- Google Maps shows same chain restaurants repeatedly
- Decision fatigue wins, order from familiar spot again (even when tired of it)

**Current Behavior:**

- Screenshot Instagram food posts, never look at them again
- Save restaurants on Google Maps, list grows to 200+ with no organization
- Ask "Anyone been to [restaurant]?" in group chats
- Default to same 5 restaurants when brain is tired
- Scroll DoorDash for 15 minutes reading menus, give up, order pizza
- Take photos of good meals but don't track where they ate

**What They Want:**

- Answer to "What should I eat?" that actually matches their mood/craving
- Remember great restaurants they've tried (and avoid repeating bad ones)
- Discover new places without risk of wasting money on bad food
- Quick decision when brain is fried from work
- Trust recommendations (not paid placements or fake reviews)
- Track dining history so they can return to favorites

### Company Background: Founder Story

Marcus stood in his kitchen at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday, stomach growling, phone in hand, paralyzed. Open on his screen: DoorDash (scrolled entire menu twice), Yelp (5-star reviews looked fake), Google Maps (same chains), Instagram (beautiful photos, zero restaurant names he could remember). Partner asked "What do you want for dinner?" He said "I don't know, what do you want?" They both wanted the other person to decide.

This happened 4-5 nights a week. The decision exhaustion was worse than actual hunger. They'd default to the same Thai place (again) not because they wanted it, but because deciding felt impossible.

He started tracking every restaurant they tried—name, date, what they ordered, did they love it—in a small notebook he kept in his car. When the "what should we eat?" question hit, he'd flip through, find something they'd loved two months ago and forgotten about, and decide in 30 seconds.

Friends noticed. "How do you always have an answer?" He showed them the notebook—43 restaurants in 6 months, notes like "amazing dumplings," "slow service but worth it," "date night spot," "quick lunch." They wanted copies of his system.

*"The problem isn't that there aren't good restaurants. The problem is deciding when your brain is fried and you can't remember what you've already tried."*

Let'sEat! became that system—an app that learns from where you've eaten and what you loved, suggests based on your current mood/craving, and tracks your dining history in a physical passport so "What should we eat?" has an actual answer.

### Brand Positioning

**For** diners ages 25-45 who eat out or order delivery 3-8 times weekly but struggle with decision paralysis and forgetting great restaurants they've tried, **Let'sEat!** is a restaurant discovery system **that** learns your preferences and answers "What do I want to eat?" based on your mood, craving, and dining history—eliminating scrolling paralysis and repeat-spot fatigue. **Unlike** Yelp reviews from strangers or algorithm-driven apps pushing paid placements, **Let'sEat!** recommends based on your actual dining patterns, tracks where you've been so you remember favorites, and answers the daily question in seconds not 20 minutes of scrolling.

### Key Brand Messages

**Primary Message:** Never wonder "What should I eat?" again.

**Supporting Messages:**

- Your dining history remembers what your brain forgets
- Recommendations based on your taste, not paid placements
- Answer "What do I want?" in your current mood (quick lunch | date night | comfort food | trying something new)
- Track where you've been, discover where you'll love next
- Decision in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes of scrolling

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What Let'sEat! Is

A recommendation engine that learns your dining preferences and answers "What should I eat?" based on your mood, occasion, and history. Unlike review platforms (Yelp, Google) or delivery apps showing paid placements, Let'sEat! tracks where you've eaten, what you loved, patterns in your choices (Friday date nights = nicer restaurants, Wednesday exhaustion = quick comfort food), and suggests based on what you're craving right now. The system includes a **preference-learning app** and **physical dining passport** that work together to eliminate decision paralysis and build dining memory.

### Physical Component: Dining Passport Booklet

**Format:** Pocket-sized booklet (approximately 4"x6") | 100+ pages | Elastic band closure | Fits in purse/jacket pocket

**Structure:**

- **Tried & Loved** section: Restaurant name | Date | What you ordered | Quick rating (loved it / pretty good / skip) | Notes ("amazing tacos" / "date night worthy" / "slow service")
- **Want to Try** section: Restaurant name | How you found it (friend rec / Instagram / drove past) | Type of meal (quick lunch / special occasion / trying new cuisine)
- **Stamps/Stickers**: Monthly dining tracker (stamp for each restaurant tried—visual progress)
- **City Pages**: If you travel, track restaurants by city
- **Quick Reference**: Favorites by category (best pizza, best date spot, best quick lunch, best comfort food)

**Key Features:**

- **Portable** (fits in pocket, take to restaurants)
- **Quick capture** (check boxes and one-line notes, not essays)
- **Visual tracking** (stamps show dining exploration progress)
- **Conversation starter** (pull out at dinner, friends want to see it)

**Why Physical Passport Matters:**

- Tangible dining achievement (collecting experiences like travel stamps)
- No phone needed at restaurant (write while eating, no screen rudeness)
- Gifting potential (couples can share one, friend groups can compare)
- Memory trigger (flipping pages reminds you of meals you've forgotten)

### Digital Component: Restaurant Recommendation App

**Core Features:**

- **"What Should I Eat?" Button:** ONE button on home screen | Answer questions: mood (quick/casual/nice), craving (type of food), who (solo/date/group), time available | App suggests 3 restaurants based on your history + preferences
- **Dining History Tracker:** Every restaurant tried with date, rating, notes | Syncs with passport entries via photo capture
- **Pattern Learning:** Notices "You eat Thai on Tuesdays," "Date nights = Italian," "Bad day = comfort food" | Uses patterns to suggest
- **Discovery Mode:** "Try Something New" shows restaurants outside your usual that match your taste patterns
- **Craving Search:** "I want tacos" shows all taco places you've loved + new suggestions | "I want something cozy" filters by mood
- **Recommendation Source Tracking:** Tag how you found restaurant (friend suggested / Instagram / drove past) | Learn which sources lead to places you love

**Advanced Features:**

- **Location-Based:** "Near me now" filters for lunch breaks, business travel
- **Occasion Tags:** Quick lunch | Date night | Family dinner | Solo treat | Business meal | Group hangout
- **Delivery Integration:** Links to DoorDash/Uber Eats for places you've loved (skip menu browsing)
- **Friend Sharing:** "Let's eat here together" invites with shared decision-making
- **Avoid List:** Track places you didn't like so app never suggests again
- **Price Filter:** Budget-conscious day vs. splurge occasion

### How Physical + Digital Work Together

**Before Trying a Restaurant:**

- **App:** Friend recommends a place, add to "Want to Try" list with source tag
- **Passport:** Write it in "Want to Try" section with note about why it sounds good

**During/After the Meal:**

- **Passport:** While eating or right after, quick note—what you ordered, loved it or not, occasion type
- **App:** Photo-capture passport entry (auto-fills restaurant name, date, rating, notes)

**When Deciding Where to Eat:**

- **App:** Press "What Should I Eat?" | Answer quick questions (mood/craving/time) | App suggests from your "Tried & Loved" history OR new places matching your patterns
- **Passport:** Flip through "Tried & Loved" pages to remember forgotten favorites | Check "Want to Try" for places you've been meaning to visit

**Pattern Recognition Flow:**

- App analyzes: You've been to 8 Mexican restaurants, loved 6, two were "quick lunch" occasions
- Pattern learned: You like Mexican food, especially for casual quick meals
- Next time you answer "quick lunch" + "casual" mood: App suggests Mexican place you haven't tried yet that matches loved-place patterns
- After trying it: Add to passport, photo-capture, app learns more about your taste

### Why This Works When Others Don't

**Yelp:** Reviews from strangers with unknown taste alignment | Fake reviews from bots or angry customers | Can't remember if you've been somewhere | Paid placement manipulation | No mood/occasion filtering.

**Google Maps:** Shows chain restaurants prominently | Paid ads disguised as results | Saves list grows unmanageable | No dining history tracking | Generic "people also searched" suggestions.

**DoorDash/Uber Eats:** Optimized for delivery fees not food quality | Paid placements | Endless scrolling through menus | No memory of what you've tried | Decision paralysis enabler.

**Instagram/TikTok:** Beautiful photos, zero context about quality | Can't remember restaurant names from videos | Hype ≠ actual good food | No way to track what you've tried.

**Friend Recommendations:** Great when you can remember them | Lose track in text threads | Don't know if their taste matches yours | Can't search by mood/occasion.

**Let'sEat! Difference:** Learns YOUR taste (not crowd ratings), tracks YOUR dining history (so you remember), answers the decision based on YOUR current mood/craving (not generic suggestions), combines tangible passport achievement with digital intelligence. Solves "What should I eat?" in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes of scrolling paralysis.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Priya, 29, Marketing Coordinator

Priya eats out 4-5 times per week—lunch near office, dinner after work, weekend brunch. Income ~$48K. Lives with roommate. Her problem: she has 200+ restaurants saved on Google Maps from Instagram posts and friend recommendations, completely unorganized. When deciding where to eat, she scrolls the entire list, can't remember why she saved half of them, gets overwhelmed, orders from the same poke bowl place again. She's tried amazing restaurants and completely forgotten about them two months later. Friends ask "Know any good sushi spots?" and her mind blanks even though she's been to three great places.

**How Let'sEat! helps:** App's "What Should I Eat?" asks her mood (quick/casual/nice) and craving. She answers "casual" and "feeling adventurous." App suggests a Vietnamese place she loved 6 weeks ago and forgot about. Passport has the entry: "banh mi was incredible." Decision made in 30 seconds. After 3 months, she's built a reliable dining history she can actually reference instead of forgotten screenshots.

**Design takeaway:** Emphasize speed of decision—"30 seconds not 30 minutes" should be visible/measurable in UI design.

### User Story 2: Marcus & Chen, 34 & 36, Couple (Teacher & Nurse)

They eat out 3-4 times per week, mostly dinner after exhausting workdays. Combined income ~$95K. Their problem: the "What do you want for dinner?" / "I don't know, what do you want?" loop happens every single night. Both are decision-fatigued from work. They end up at the same five restaurants repeatedly not because they want to, but because their brains can't handle choosing. They've tried great date-night spots and never returned because they forget. DoorDash scrolling takes 20 minutes and ends in frustration.

**How Let'sEat! helps:** They share one dining passport, take turns adding entries. When decision fatigue hits, Marcus opens app, presses "What Should I Eat?", answers "casual" + "comfort food." App suggests the Thai place they loved two months ago (passport note: "curry was perfect"). Decision made without argument. Friday date nights, app filters to their "special occasion" tagged favorites. Decision becomes 1-minute conversation not 20-minute negotiation.

**Design takeaway:** Make shared passport/account functionality prominent—couples are a major use case for solving decision paralysis together.

### User Story 3: Aisha, 27, Freelance Designer

Aisha eats solo lunches 4-5 times per week, orders delivery 2-3 times weekly. Income ~$52K. Works from home. Her problem: she tries new restaurants when exploring the city but forgets their names or locations. She'll walk past a place weeks later and think "Have I been here?" with no memory. Her phone has 40+ food photos with zero location tags. When ordering delivery, she scrolls DoorDash for 15 minutes, can't decide, orders pizza again (third time this week). She wants to try new cuisines but decision paralysis keeps her in comfort zone.

**How Let'sEat! helps:** Passport goes in her bag when exploring. Tries a great sandwich shop, writes it down immediately with neighborhood location. App's photo-capture syncs it with GPS tag. Weeks later, app's "Near me now" shows that sandwich shop when she's in the area. "Discovery Mode" suggests Ethiopian restaurant based on her pattern of loving bold flavors—she tries it, loves it, adds to passport. Her dining territory expands because app pushes her gently outside comfort zone with smart suggestions.

**Design takeaway:** Location-based reminders and "near me now" features should feel helpful not creepy—gentle nudges to remember nearby favorites.

### User Story 4: Jordan, 38, Sales Manager

Jordan eats business lunches 3-4 times per week, family dinners on weekends. Income ~$68K. Married with two kids. His problem: he needs reliable restaurant recommendations for client lunches (can't risk bad service or food), but Yelp reviews are unreliable. He's taken clients to the same three "safe" restaurants for two years. Weekend family dinners become stressful when kids reject restaurants. He forgets which places had fast service (critical with impatient kids) vs. slow romantic spots (wrong for family of four).

**How Let'sEat! helps:** Passport tags entries by occasion: "business lunch—reliable" vs. "family dinner—kid-friendly" vs. "date night with wife." App filters by occasion when suggesting. Client lunch tomorrow? App shows his "business lunch" favorites with notes like "great service, quiet enough to talk." Weekend with kids? App suggests tagged "kid-friendly" spots he's tried and loved. He builds specialized lists without maintaining multiple apps or spreadsheets.

**Design takeaway:** Occasion tagging and filtering must be intuitive and quick—users shouldn't spend time organizing, system should learn from minimal input.

## PART 4: STRATEGIC GUIDANCE

### Print Deliverable Options (Choose 2 Beyond Required Packaging)

**Required: Dining Passport Booklet Packaging**
How does packaging communicate this is a lifestyle tool, not just a notebook? Should packaging include app download QR code and quick-start guide?

**Option 3: Point-of-Sale Display for Gift Shops/Bookstores**
Counter or shelf presence for impulse gift purchases. What information beyond package? How prominently feature "Solves 'What should I eat?' decision fatigue"? Should display include sample passport pages (flip-through)? Format: countertop stand, shelf talker, hanging display? Consider: Gifting occasions (holidays, housewarming, couples, foodies), price visibility, "As seen on…" social proof if applicable.

**Option 4: Sticker Sheet Set (Passport Accessories)**

Categories: cuisine types (taco, sushi, pizza icons) | occasions (date night heart, quick lunch clock, celebration confetti) | ratings (loved it stars, pretty good check, skip X). Packaging: single sheet, multi-pack, included with passport or sold separately? Consider: Instagram-worthy aesthetic, functional categorization, collectible series.

**Option 5: Direct Mail Campaign Piece**
Targets decision-fatigued professionals who eat out frequently. What format breaks through? (postcard showing "You scrolled DoorDash for 20 minutes last night, we can help" | folded self-mailer with passport preview | dimensional mail with sample stamp).

Consider: Personalization opportunity (city-specific), QR code tracking, gift promotion angle.

**Option 6: Print Ad Series (Minimum 3 Ads)**
Where run? (Food magazines, city lifestyle publications, airport magazines for travelers). Sequential campaign or standalone messages? Hook options: "Scrolling DoorDash again?" | "You've eaten there 6 times this month" | "Remember that amazing restaurant? Neither do we." How show physical + digital without looking complicated? Consider: One product focus per ad vs. integrated, problem/solution format, testimonial-style.

**Option 7: Restaurant Partnership Posters (3-5 Posters)**
For restaurants to display: "Let'sEat! users—stamp your passport here!" Creates collection incentive. How much restaurant branding vs. Let'sEat! branding? Should posters include space for restaurant to add custom stamp design? Format: table tent, window cling, wall poster? Consider: Co-branding guidelines, restaurant categories (participating locations), limited edition stamps for special events.

### Digital Deliverable Options (Choose 2, or 1 if Designing Physical Product)

**Option 5: Digital Advertising Campaign (Minimum 6 Ad Variations)**
Where run: Instagram/Facebook, Google search ("best restaurants near me"), food delivery app banner space, podcast pre-roll companion display. Hook that stops scroll: "Still scrolling DoorDash?" | "You ate there 6 times last month" | "What should we eat? [pause] We have an answer." Segment variations: solo diners, couples, families, business travelers. Consider: Video (decision paralysis relatability) vs. static, testimonial vs. product demo, retargeting vs. cold audience.

**Option 6: App Store Presence (Complete Listing)**
iOS App Store and/or Google Play. What makes download vs. scroll past? Screenshots showcase: "What Should I Eat?" button and decision flow, dining history with passport entries, discovery mode suggestions, occasion filtering, quick stats (47 restaurants tried!). Which feature first: most impressive or most essential? App icon design, description copy (first 2 lines critical), feature bullets. Consider: "Restaurant Discovery" category is crowded, how differentiate from Yelp/Google, seasonal angle (New Year resolution to try new places).

**Option 7: Animated Explainer Video Concept (Storyboard + Key Frames)**
Length: 60 seconds for social, 90 for website. Animation style: energetic motion graphics, relatable illustrated characters, hybrid with real food footage? Narrative: Problem (scrolling paralysis, forgetting restaurants) → Solution (app + passport working together) → Result (quick decisions, dining exploration). How much time on features vs. emotional benefit? Consider: Voiceover tone (enthusiastic friend, relatable not preachy), music energy, ending CTA (download app, get passport, answer "What Should I Eat?" now).

### Research Guidance

**Audience Research:**
Search: r/askculinary, r/foodhacks, r/eatcheapandhealthy subreddits | #FoodTok, #RestaurantRec hashtags | Twitter threads "where should I eat in [city]" | Food delivery app reviews (DoorDash, Uber Eats—read complaints).

Find: Language people use about decision fatigue | "What should we eat?" frustration stories | Complaints about Yelp (fake reviews, unreliable) | How people currently track favorite restaurants (or don't) | Decision paralysis patterns (scrolling forever, defaulting to same spots).

**Competitive Research:**
Research: Restaurant discovery apps (Yelp, Google Maps, The Infatuation app) | Food delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber Eats) | Recommendation apps in other categories (Letterboxd for movies, Vivino for wine) | Travel journaling apps.

Analyze: Visual territory (lots of food photography, review-focused—how differentiate?) | Messaging approaches (reviews vs. recommendations vs. discovery) | What makes decision-making easy vs. hard in UI? | Where do users complain about paralysis or forgotten favorites? | Who does physical + digital combo well?

**Visual Research:**
Look: Dribbble/Behance (search: food app, dining journal, passport design, recommendation engine) | Travel passport designs (for stamp/collection inspiration) | Food magazine layouts | Restaurant branding (energy, colors, typography that feels hungry/excited).

Collect: Color palettes that feel energetic and appetizing (not corporate) | Typography that's friendly and enthusiastic | Passport/journal layouts (quick-capture formats) | Food photography styles (real not stock, craveable not precious) | Stamp/sticker aesthetics.

**Market Research:**
Find statistics: How often Americans eat out or order delivery | Decision fatigue research (psychology studies) | Food delivery app market size and growth | Yelp user satisfaction rates | Restaurant discovery behavior patterns | Dining spending by age demographic.

Look: Pew Research, National Restaurant Association data | Food industry reports | App Annie/Sensor Tower (food app downloads, retention) | Nielsen dining behavior studies | Academic research on decision paralysis and choice overload.

### Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need from them:**

- Recommendation algorithm specs (how does it learn from passport entries and app behavior?)
- Decision flow logic (how does "What Should I Eat?" questioning work? how many questions before suggestion?)
- Pattern recognition capabilities (can it detect "Friday = date night" or "tired = comfort food"?)
- Photo-capture/OCR for passport sync (how accurate is handwriting recognition? limitations?)
- Location services implementation (geofencing for "near me now" reminders, privacy considerations?)

**What they need from you:**

- Brand assets (logo with exclamation point, color codes, typography for app UI)
- UI design specs (screen layouts, button styles, decision flow screens, component library)
- Iconography (mood icons, cuisine types, occasion markers, rating systems—consistent visual language)
- Microcopy (app prompts, error messages, empty states, celebration messages for milestones)
- User flow priorities (is "What Should I Eat?" button always visible? navigation hierarchy?)

**How to work together:**
Regular check-ins about technical constraints affecting design. Ask early about feasibility (Can photo-capture read handwriting reliably? How fast can decision algorithm respond?). Share work-in-progress for feedback. Be open to technical limitations requiring design adaptation. Explain rationale (why enthusiastic tone matters, why one big button vs. multiple options reduces paralysis). They're building the intelligence, you're designing the confidence—both essential to solving decision fatigue.

### Final Reminders

This is not fill-in-the-blank work—creativity happens in how you interpret "enthusiastic friend who has answers." Food apps often look either corporate-sterile (Yelp) or overwhelmingly busy (delivery apps). Let'sEat! should feel like a confident friend who says "Oh! Try this place!" when you're stuck. Your unique value proposition is **answering "What should I eat?" in 30 seconds by learning your taste and tracking your dining history**—not reviews from strangers, not paid placements, not endless scrolling. Emphasize physical + digital integration—passport builds tangible achievement, app provides intelligence, together they eliminate decision paralysis. Every design decision needs rationale. This is portfolio-worthy work demonstrating: brand positioning for behavioral change, solving universal pain point (decision fatigue), physical + digital product ecosystem, enthusiastic tone without being annoying.

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this feel like an enthusiastic friend or a pushy salesperson?
- Am I showing how 30-second decisions actually work (not just claiming it)?
- Does the passport feel like an achievement tracker not just a notebook?
- Would this make someone choose Let'sEat! over free Yelp or familiar DoorDash?
- Does the design reduce decision fatigue or add to it?

# PART 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

## Overview: Bridging Design to Development

This section provides technical implementation guidance for design students working on Let'sEat!. Understanding how your design decisions map to the underlying Recommendation Engine architecture ensures your creative vision can actually be built—and helps you create more sophisticated, implementation-aware design work.

Let'sEat! is one of several white-label configurations of the **Recommendation Engine Platform™**, a flexible preference-learning system built by programming students. Your design work will be implemented through configuration, theming, and feature toggles—not custom code.

**Key insight:** Let'sEat! uses the same database, recommendation logic, and core features as Bookmark™, EventFlow™, and other applications. What differentiates Let'sEat! is its energetic voice, dining-focused features, decision-speed emphasis, and brand identity designed for decision-fatigued diners seeking quick, reliable answers.

## 5.1 Engine Capability Mapping

**How Let'sEat! Features Map to Recommendation Engine Platform Capabilities**

The Recommendation Engine Platform provides a robust preference-learning system. Let'sEat! doesn't reinvent the wheel—it configures and brands existing capabilities with a dining-focused, decision-eliminating approach.

### Items → Restaurants

**Platform capability:** CRUD operations for items with attributes, categories, user ratings, and recommendation generation.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Item = **Restaurant** (energetic, not "establishment" or "location")
- Standard item fields:
  - `title` → Restaurant name
  - `creator` → N/A (not applicable for restaurants)
  - `item_type` → Cuisine type (Mexican, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, etc.)
  - `description` → Restaurant vibe/specialty
  - `image_url` → Restaurant photo (exterior, signature dish, or ambiance)
  - `external_id` → Yelp ID or Google Places ID
- Additional metadata fields:
  - `cuisine_type` (Mexican, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, American, etc.)
  - `price_level` ($ to $$$$)
  - `location_address` (full address for GPS)
  - `neighborhood` (e.g., "Downtown," "West End")
  - `occasion_tags` (quick lunch, date night, family dinner, business meal)
  - `hours` (open/close times for "open now" filtering)
  - `delivery_available` (boolean, links to DoorDash/Uber Eats)

**Design implications:**
- Restaurant cards prominently display name, cuisine, and photo
- Typography hierarchy: Restaurant Name (largest), Cuisine Type (prominent), Price/Distance (subtle)
- Restaurant photos should be appetizing, showing food or warm ambiance
- Location/neighborhood searchable and filterable
- Occasion tags displayed as visual badges
- "Open now" indicator with hours displayed

### Ratings → Dining Experience

**Platform capability:** User ratings with numerical scale, written reviews, timestamps, and recommendation engine learning.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Rating = **Dining Experience** (enthusiastic, not clinical)
- Quick rating (Loved it / Pretty good / Skip) labeled as "How was it?"
- **What you ordered** (text field): "Amazing tacos" | "The curry was perfect" | "Tried the dumplings"
- **Occasion type** (dropdown): Quick lunch | Date night | Family dinner | Solo treat | Business meal | Group hangout
- **Notes** (optional text field): Quick one-liners ("slow service but worth it")
- **Completion date** (when dined)
- **Source** (who recommended): Friend | Instagram | Drove past | Food blogger

**Design implications:**
- Quick rating emphasized (large buttons: Loved it / Pretty good / Skip)
- "What you ordered" text field prominent (helps memory and recommendations)
- Occasion tags quick-select (checkboxes or pills)
- Notes field conversational ("Any other thoughts?")
- Source tracking integrated naturally ("How'd you find this place?")
- Visual hierarchy: quick rating > what you ordered > occasion > notes
- Dining experience capture should feel fast, not like homework

### Attributes → Restaurant Characteristics

**Platform capability:** Multi-valued attributes that categorize items, enable filtering, and power recommendation similarity matching.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Attributes = **Cuisine, Mood, Occasion, Price**
- **Cuisine tags:** Mexican, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mediterranean, American, Korean, Ethiopian, Burgers, Pizza, Sandwiches, Seafood, BBQ, Vegetarian, Vegan
- **Mood tags:** Cozy, Upscale, Casual, Lively, Romantic, Quick, Adventurous, Comfort food
- **Occasion tags:** Quick lunch, Date night, Family dinner, Business meal, Solo treat, Group hangout, Special celebration
- **Price tags:** $ (budget), $$ (moderate), $$$ (pricey), $$$$ (splurge)
- Each attribute has:
  - `attribute_name` (specific tag)
  - `attribute_category` (cuisine, mood, occasion, price)
  - `color_code` (for visual consistency)
  - `icon` (visual indicator)

**Design implications:**
- Cuisine tags use vibrant, appetizing colors (not corporate)
- Mood tags feel energetic and decisive (warm orange for cozy, bold red for lively)
- Tag selection multi-select (restaurants can have multiple moods/occasions)
- Price level displayed with $ symbols (intuitive)
- Visual differentiation: cuisine tags warm colors, mood tags energetic tones, occasion tags functional icons
- Tags searchable/filterable: "Show me casual Mexican restaurants"

### Recommendations → "What Should I Eat?"

**Platform capability:** Algorithm generates personalized suggestions based on user ratings, attribute preferences, and similarity patterns.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Recommendation = **"What Should I Eat?"** or **"Try This!"**
- Recommendation reasoning displayed: "You love Thai food for quick lunches—this spot matches that pattern"
- **Decision flow:** App asks 3-4 quick questions (mood? cuisine craving? occasion? time available?) then suggests 3 restaurants
- **Pattern-based suggestions:** "You eat Mexican on Tuesdays" | "Date nights = Italian restaurants"
- **Discovery Mode:** Suggests restaurants outside usual cuisines but matching mood/occasion patterns
- Recommendations include:
  - Restaurant details (name, cuisine, photo, distance)
  - **Why this recommendation** (specific reason based on dining patterns)
  - **Confidence level** (high/medium based on pattern strength)
  - **Location context** ("5 min away," "Near your office")
  - **Your past experience** (if you've been before: "You loved it 2 months ago!")

**Design implications:**
- Giant "What Should I Eat?" button on home screen (primary action)
- Decision flow questions feel conversational and fast
- Recommendation cards show restaurant photo prominently
- "Why" explanation given visual emphasis (not fine print)
- Discovery Mode suggestions visually distinct (special badge: "Try Something New!")
- Location/distance displayed clearly
- Easy actions: "Let's Go!" (directions), "Add to Want to Try," "Not Interested"
- Visual language: enthusiastic, decisive, confident

### Sources → Discovery Sources

**Platform capability:** Track where items come from, analyze source reliability, filter by source.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Source = **Discovery Source** (how you found this restaurant)
- Source types:
  - **Friend** (with name: "Sarah," "Coworker Mike")
  - **Instagram** (with account: "@foodblogger," "@chef_sarah")
  - **Drove Past** (saw it while out)
  - **Food Blogger/Influencer**
  - **Magazine/Publication** (Eater, local food mag)
  - **Other** (user-defined)
- **Source hit rate tracking:** Shows percentage of recommendations from source that you loved
- **Source alignment score:** How well this source's taste matches yours

**Design implications:**
- Source tagging conversational ("How'd you hear about this?")
- Source names personal and specific ("Sarah" not "Friend #1")
- Source analysis shows which friends/accounts have best hit rate
- High-performing sources celebrated (star icon, special color)
- Low-performing sources neutral (no shame, just data)
- Visual language: "Your trusted food guides"

### Wishlists → Want to Try Lists

**Platform capability:** User-created lists to organize items, with notes and priorities.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- Wishlist = **"Want to Try"** list
- Default list: "Want to Try" (main list)
- Custom lists encouraged: "Date Night Options," "Quick Lunch Spots Near Office," "Weekend Brunch Ideas"
- Each Want to Try entry includes:
  - **Restaurant name and cuisine**
  - **Who recommended** (source)
  - **Why it sounds good** (user note: "Heard the tacos are amazing")
  - **Mood/occasion tags** (what you're seeking)
  - **Priority** (high/medium/low)
  - **Date added** (to track how long it's been waiting)

**Design implications:**
- "Want to Try" list feels aspirational, not overwhelming
- Sorting/filtering essential: by priority, cuisine, location, source
- Visual indicators: restaurants from high-hit-rate sources highlighted
- "Why you added this" reminder shown when viewing months later
- Easy re-prioritization (quick toggle or drag-and-drop)
- Visual language: exciting discovery list, not guilt-inducing backlog
- Empty state: "Hungry for adventure? Add your first restaurant!"

### User Profiles → Dining Profiles

**Platform capability:** User accounts with preferences, history, and personalization settings.

**Let'sEat! mapping:**
- User = **Diner**
- Profile includes:
  - **Dining preferences:** Favorite cuisines, moods, occasions
  - **Dining goals:** Restaurants per month, cuisine diversity targets
  - **Pattern tracking:** Day-of-week preferences (Friday = date night), mood correlations (bad day = comfort food)
  - **Location preferences:** Home neighborhood, work location, frequent areas
  - **Dietary restrictions:** Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, allergies
- **Dining stats:** Restaurants tried, cuisines explored, favorite spots, repeat visits

**Design implications:**
- Profile feels personal and food-focused (not data-driven)
- Dining goals displayed enthusiastically ("Try 20 new restaurants this year!")
- Pattern insights celebrated ("You love Thai food on Tuesdays!")
- Dietary restrictions integrated naturally (filters out incompatible restaurants)
- Stats celebrate dining exploration: "You've tried 47 restaurants across 12 cuisines!"
- Visual language: energetic, encouraging, food-loving

### How Developers Use This Configuration

**Terminology replacement throughout application:**

```python
# Example Flask template using configuration
from config import get_brand_config

config = get_brand_config('letseat')

# In template:
<h1>{{ config.terminology.recommendation_plural }}</h1>
# Renders: <h1>What Should I Eat?</h1>

# Decision button:
<button class="decision-button-primary">
  {{ config.terminology.decision_button }}
</button>
# Renders: <button>What Should I Eat?</button>
```

**Decision flow rendering:**

```javascript
// Example React component using configuration
import brandConfig from '@/config/brands/letseat.json';

function DecisionFlow() {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);

  const moodQuestion = brandConfig.message_templates.decision_flow_mood;

  return (
    <div className="decision-flow">
      <h2>{moodQuestion.title}</h2>
      <p>{moodQuestion.message}</p>
      <div className="options">
        {moodQuestion.options.map(option => (
          <button key={option} className="mood-option">
            {option}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Component Library Expectations

Developers benefit from a **design system** documenting reusable components. Let'sEat! component library should include:

**Core Components:**

1. **Buttons**
   - Hero button (giant "What Should I Eat?" primary action)
   - Primary (main actions: "Add Restaurant," "Let's Go!")
   - Secondary (neutral actions: "Cancel," "Skip")
   - Quick-action pills (cuisine filters, mood selections)
   - Sizes: small, medium, large, hero
   - States: default, hover, active, disabled

2. **Cards**
   - Restaurant card (photo, name, cuisine, price, distance)
   - Recommendation card (restaurant + why + confidence + actions)
   - Dining experience card (what you ordered, rating, occasion)
   - Want to Try card (restaurant + why added + source)
   - States: default, selected, highlighted, dismissed

3. **Tags/Badges**
   - Cuisine tags (Mexican, Thai, Italian—colorful, appetizing)
   - Mood tags (cozy, romantic, quick—energetic colors)
   - Occasion badges (date night, quick lunch—functional icons)
   - Discovery badge ("Try Something New!")
   - Pattern badge ("Your Friday Pattern")

4. **Form Elements**
   - Text inputs (restaurant name, what you ordered)
   - Textareas (notes, why it sounds good)
   - Dropdowns (source selection, occasion selection)
   - Multi-select (cuisine tags, mood tags)
   - Quick rating (3 large buttons: Loved it / Pretty good / Skip)
   - Star rating (optional, de-emphasized)

5. **Decision Flow Components**
   - Hero button ("What Should I Eat?")
   - Question cards (mood, craving, occasion, who)
   - Option buttons (quick, casual, nice)
   - Progress indicator (step 1 of 3)
   - Suggestion cards (3 restaurant options)

7. **Navigation**
   - Bottom tab bar (mobile: Home, Want to Try, Add, Discover, Profile)
   - Top navigation bar (desktop: What Should I Eat?, History, Discover, Profile)

**Component Documentation Format:**

Each component documented with:
- **Visual example** (screenshot or live preview)
- **Usage guidelines** (when to use this component)
- **Anatomy** (labeled diagram of component parts)
- **Specifications** (dimensions, spacing, typography, colors)
- **States** (default, hover, active, disabled)
- **Code snippets** (HTML/CSS or React component example)

**Delivery format options:**
- **Figma component library** (preferred for web-based handoff)
- **Adobe XD component library** (if Adobe workflow)
- **PDF design system documentation** (static reference)
- **Storybook** (if design team builds interactive documentation)

### Handoff Tools and Process

**Recommended handoff platforms:**

1. **Figma (preferred):**
   - Share link to Figma file with developer permissions
   - Use Figma Inspect mode for CSS extraction
   - Organize frames by screen/component
   - Include annotations for interactions
   - Export assets directly from Figma

2. **Zeplin:**
   - Upload designs from Figma/Sketch
   - Automatic CSS generation
   - Asset export in multiple formats
   - Comment and annotation tools

3. **Adobe XD:**
   - Share link with developer access
   - Specs panel for measurements
   - Export assets panel

## 5.5 API Integration Points

**Where Design Touches Code: UI Components and Data Requirements**

Let'sEat! interface components consume data from backend APIs. Understanding these integration points helps designers create realistic, implementable interfaces.

### Dashboard Components and Data Requirements

**Dashboard:** Primary landing page with giant "What Should I Eat?" button.

**Components:**

1. **"What Should I Eat?" Hero Button**
   - **Data source:** None (triggers decision flow)
   - **Action:** Opens decision flow modal/screen
   - **Design considerations:** Largest element on screen, gradient background, prominent placement

2. **Recent Favorites Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/dining-history/recent-favorites?limit=5`
   - **Response:** `{ restaurants: [{name, cuisine, photo_url, last_visit_date, quick_rating}] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when new dining experience added
   - **Design considerations:** Horizontal scroll, restaurant photos prominent, quick ratings displayed

3. **Want to Try Highlights**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/want-to-try/highlights?limit=5`
   - **Response:** `{ restaurants: [{name, cuisine, why_added, source_name, priority, days_since_added}] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when Want to Try modified
   - **Design considerations:** Priority badges, aging indicator for old entries, source attribution

4. **Dining Stats**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/stats/summary`
   - **Response:** `{ restaurants_tried: 47, cuisines_explored: 12, this_month: 8, favorite_cuisine: "Thai" }`
   - **Update frequency:** Daily refresh
   - **Design considerations:** Visual counters, cuisine diversity chart, celebration language

5. **Pattern Insights**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/patterns/current`
   - **Response:** `{ patterns: ["You love Thai on Tuesdays", "Friday = date night", "Bad weather = comfort food"] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Weekly analysis
   - **Design considerations:** Playful icons, conversational language, visual pattern indicators

6. **Nearby Restaurants**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/restaurants/nearby?radius=5`
   - **Response:** Array of nearby restaurants with `{ name, cuisine, distance, open_now, your_rating }`
   - **Update frequency:** Location-based, refreshes when user moves
   - **Design considerations:** Distance displayed prominently, "open now" badge, map integration

**Loading states:** All dashboard components must handle:
- Initial load (skeleton screens with energetic branding)
- Empty state (no data yet: "Let's build your dining history!")
- Error state (API failure: "We're having trouble loading. Tap to retry.")

# PART 6: CROSS-DISCIPLINE WORKFLOW

## Overview: How Design and Development Teams Collaborate

Let'sEat! succeeds through coordinated effort between design students (creating brand identity and user experience) and programming students (building the Recommendation Engine Platform). Neither discipline can work in isolation—designers need technical constraints, developers need visual specifications.

This collaboration mirrors real-world product development where designers and engineers must communicate across different professional languages and priorities.

-----

- All user-facing copy (button labels, prompts, messages) should feel like an enthusiastic friend
- Avoid corporate language, overthinking prompts, or paralysis-inducing options
- Example: "What are you craving?" not "Please select your preferred cuisine category"
- Example: "Let's Go!" not "Navigate to restaurant"

**Development team responsibility:**
- Preserve designer-written copy exactly (don't "clean it up" to sound more technical)
- If copy needs adjustment for technical reasons, consult designer first
- Example: Don't change "Try Something New!" to "Discovery Mode Activated"

**Shared responsibility:**
- Both teams should use Let'sEat! voice in communication ("We're building something awesome!")
- Celebrate milestones enthusiastically ("Decision flow is working—it's SO FAST!")
- Remember: Let'sEat! solves decision fatigue with confidence and speed, not more options

## Common Collaboration Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge:** Designer creates beautiful hero button, developer says it's too complex to implement.
**Solution:** Designer and developer meet to discuss constraints. Designer creates 2-3 simplified versions. Developer chooses most feasible. Designer ensures simplified version still captures brand energy.

**Challenge:** Developer implements decision flow with 7 questions to improve accuracy.
**Solution:** Designer reminds developer that Let'sEat! is about SPEED ("30 seconds not 30 minutes"). Both agree: 3-4 questions maximum, even if less accurate. Speed beats perfection for this brand.

**Challenge:** Designer wants custom animated cuisine icons, developer says animations hurt performance.
**Solution:** Start with static SVG icons (fast implementation). Add subtle CSS animations later if time permits. Both agree: functional > fancy for MVP.

**Challenge:** Designer delivers assets in random folder structure, developer can't find specific icons.
**Solution:** Designer reorganizes assets following naming convention guide. Developer provides feedback on which structure works best for their build system. Both document for future projects.

**Challenge:** Designer's color palette has 20 shades of orange, developer doesn't know which to use where.
**Solution:** Designer creates color usage guide: "Primary orange for hero button and main CTAs, Secondary peach for secondary actions, Accent teal for discovery features." Developer implements as CSS variables.

- Assets delivered on time (Week 7)
- Assets properly formatted (SVG icons, correct naming, organized folders)
- Component library documented clearly
- Responsive to developer questions Week 8+
- Final presentation demonstrates understanding of technical implementation

**Development team:**
- Questions asked early (Weeks 2-4, not Week 7)
- Design feedback provided constructively
- Technical constraints communicated clearly
- Design assets integrated (even if partially) by final demo
- Final presentation credits design work appropriately

**Joint success:**
- Let'sEat! brand feels cohesive (enthusiastic voice in UI)
