# CREATIVE BRIEF: BOOKMARK

**Platform:** Recommendation Engine (Preference-Learning System)
**White-Label Application:** Book Recommendations + Reading Journal
**Target Market:** Regular readers seeking better discovery and reading memory

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **Bookmark**, a book recommendation platform that helps readers remember why they wanted to read something and how it made them feel. Unlike algorithmic recommendation services that trap readers in filter bubbles, Bookmark captures the context around reading—who recommended it, what mood you were seeking, the feeling it gave you—so readers build a meaningful relationship with their reading life instead of just consuming and forgetting.

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines a **preference-learning app** with a **physical reading journal**. The challenge is designing for readers who love books but struggle to remember what they've read, why they added books to their TBR list, and whether recommendations from various sources actually match their taste.

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 28-45 | Income $45K-$80K | College-educated | Urban/suburban | Professional careers

**Reading Behavior:** 2-5 books per month | Cross-genre readers | Active TBR list management | Follow book recommendations from multiple sources (podcasts, friends, social media, book clubs)

**Pain Points:**

- Can't remember books they've read or how they felt about them
- Lose track of why they added books to TBR lists
- Can't recall if they've read other books by an author
- Screenshot recommendations then forget context (who suggested it, why it sounded good)
- Goodreads feels like homework | Amazon shows same recommendations repeatedly
- Want to discover new genres but algorithms keep them in familiar territory

**Current Behavior:**

- Keep sprawling TBR lists in Notes app, Goodreads, screenshots
- Star-rate books with no context for future reference
- Rely on memory (which fails) to track reading preferences
- Trust recommendations from friends/podcasts but lose track of sources
- Want structured tracking but journaling attempts feel like work

**What They Want:**

- Remember the **feeling** books gave them, not just plot details
- Track **who** recommended books and whether their taste aligns
- Quick-capture system that doesn't feel like homework
- Discover books outside algorithm bubbles
- Build reading history they can actually reference

### Company Background: Founder Story

Jessica had read 200+ books in four years but couldn't remember half of them. She'd pick up an author's newest release and realize halfway through she'd already read their previous book—couldn't remember if she'd liked it. Her Goodreads was full of 4-star ratings with no context. Amazon kept recommending the same thrillers. She'd screenshot book recommendations from podcasts, Instagram, friends' texts, then forget where she'd seen them or why they sounded compelling.

At book club, someone asked "What's the best book you've read this year?" She froze. Forty-seven books that year. Couldn't pick one—not because they were all equal, but because she couldn't remember the **feeling** they gave her.

Goodreads reviews felt like homework. Notes app was chaos. Reading journal attempts failed because she didn't want to write essays.

She started using physical bookmarks and writing on them: book title, date finished, one sentence about the feeling, who recommended it. Simple. It worked. Friends saw her bookmark collection and wanted the system.

*"You don't need to remember everything about a book. You need to remember how it made you feel and whether to trust the person who recommended it."*

Bookmark became that system—digital app for discovery and recommendations, physical journal for memory and reflection, both working together so readers build a reading life they actually remember.

### Brand Positioning

**For** regular readers ages 28-45 who consume 2-5 books monthly but struggle to remember what they've read and why they wanted to read it, **Bookmark** is a book recommendation system **that** captures the context and feeling around reading so you build meaningful memory instead of just consuming content. **Unlike** Goodreads, Amazon, and algorithm-driven platforms that trap you in filter bubbles and reduce books to star ratings, **Bookmark** tracks why you wanted to read something, how it made you feel, and whose recommendations actually match your taste—creating a reading archive that serves your curiosity, not corporate algorithms.

### Key Brand Messages

**Primary Message:** Remember the feeling, not just the title.

**Supporting Messages:**

- Your reading life deserves better than star ratings and forgotten screenshots
- Discover books outside the algorithm bubble | Track recommendations from trusted sources
- Quick capture that doesn't feel like homework | Reading journal meets recommendation engine
- Build a reading archive that actually helps you choose what's next

### Required Deliverables

**All students must create:**

1. **Logo & Brand Identity System** (wordmark, logomark if appropriate, color system, typography)
1. **Brand Style Guide** (1-2 pages: logo usage, colors, fonts, voice/tone, visual examples)
1. **Product Packaging** (physical journal packaging—consider unboxing experience, shelf presence, premium feel)

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What Bookmark Is

A recommendation engine that learns your reading preferences and suggests books based on patterns in what you've loved—but unlike algorithmic platforms, Bookmark captures **context** (who recommended it, why you added it, what mood you were seeking) and **feeling** (emotional response, memorable moments, who else would love it). The system includes a **preference-learning app** and **physical reading journal** that work together to build reading memory.

### Physical Component: Reading Journal

**Format:** Hardcover journal (approximately 6"x8") | 200+ pages | Ribbon bookmark | Lay-flat binding

**Structure:**

- **Want to Read** section: Title | Author | Who recommended it | Why it sounds good | Mood/genre tags | Date added
- **Currently Reading** section: Start date | Page tracker | Thoughts while reading | Quotes worth saving
- **Completed** section: Finish date | One-sentence feeling | Star rating | Would recommend to (who?) | What to read next based on this

**Key Features:**

- **Quick-capture format** (fill-in-the-blank prompts, not essay prompts)
- **Recommendation source tracking** (friend name, podcast episode, Instagram account, book club)
- **Mood/feeling emphasis** (not just genre categorization)
- **Reading patterns over time** (quarterly reflection pages to see patterns)

**Why Physical Journal Matters:**

- Writing by hand improves memory retention
- No screen fatigue | Tangible archive of reading life
- Can be used without phone/app (bedside, coffee shop, waiting room)
- Premium object that honors reading as valued activity

### Digital Component: Recommendation App

**Core Features:**

- **Smart TBR Management:** Import from screenshots, podcasts, social media | Tag by mood/genre/source | Sort by priority/added date
- **Reading Tracker:** Currently reading progress | Time-to-finish estimates | Reading streak tracking
- **Recommendation Engine:** Learns from completed books, mood patterns, trusted sources | Suggests books outside filter bubble | "If you loved X, try Y because [specific reason]"
- **Source Analysis:** Tracks which recommenders have highest hit rate for you | Shows alignment percentage with your taste
- **Memory Prompts:** "You finished this 6 months ago—remember how you felt?" | "You added this because [saved reason]"
- **Discovery Mode:** Intentionally shows books outside your usual genres based on feeling/mood match

**Advanced Features:**

- **Reading Goals:** Monthly/yearly targets | Genre diversity tracking | Reading time analytics
- **Journal Sync:** Photo-capture journal pages | Digital backup of handwritten notes
- **Social (Optional):** Share recommendations with trusted circle | Private book club groups | No public reviews/ratings
- **Library Integration:** Check availability at local libraries | Indie bookstore partnership links

### How Physical + Digital Work Together

**Before Reading:**

- **App:** Add book to TBR with context (who recommended, why, mood tags)
- **Journal:** Write it in "Want to Read" with personal note about appeal

**During Reading:**

- **App:** Track progress, time reading, receive prompts
- **Journal:** Capture quotes, thoughts, memorable moments by hand

**After Reading:**

- **Journal:** Write one-sentence feeling, star rating, who'd love it
- **App:** Photo-capture journal entry, feeds recommendation engine
- **System learns:** Your taste, which sources to trust, which moods lead to loved books

**Recommendation Flow:**

- App suggests books based on feeling/mood patterns from journal entries
- Shows "You loved [Book A] because 'beautiful sentences'—try [Book B], readers describe it the same way"
- Tracks whether recommendations hit or miss, adjusts future suggestions

### Why This Works When Others Don't

**Goodreads:** Public performance, star ratings without context, algorithm serves Amazon not readers, reviews from strangers with unknown taste alignment.

**Amazon:** Recommendation engine optimized for sales not reading satisfaction, filter bubble traps you in similar books, no source tracking, no feeling/mood capture.

**StoryGraph:** Better mood tracking but purely digital (no memory benefits of handwriting), limited source attribution, recommendation algorithm still opaque.

**BookTok/Bookstagram:** Hype-driven, no personalization, recommendations disappear in feed, can't track which influencers match your taste.

**Personal Systems (Notes App/Spreadsheets):** No recommendation engine, purely manual, screenshots get lost, no pattern recognition across books.

**Bookmark Difference:** Combines analog memory benefits (handwriting, physical archive) with digital intelligence (pattern recognition, source analysis, discovery algorithms that serve readers not platforms). Captures **why** you wanted to read something so you make better decisions about **what** to read next.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Maya, 32, Marketing Manager

Maya reads 3-4 books monthly, mostly contemporary fiction and memoirs. Income ~$58K. Commutes via train, reads before bed. Her problem: she screenshots book recommendations from podcasts and Instagram, then forgets which episode or account suggested them. Her camera roll has 200+ book screenshots with zero context. She'll buy a book months later because the cover looks familiar, not remembering if the source was trustworthy. Her "system" is chaos—Goodreads TBR has 400 books, no priority order, no memory of why she added them. She wishes she could remember who recommended books that became favorites so she could trust that source again.

**How Bookmark helps:** App lets her tag screenshots with source while saving them. Journal tracks which podcast hosts' recommendations hit vs. miss. After 3 months, she sees that "Forever35" podcast has 85% hit rate while BookTok account has 20%. She trusts the data, focuses on high-value sources, stops wasting time on hyped books that aren't for her.

**Design takeaway:** Visual system needs to make source tracking feel essential, not extra work—show success rate of recommenders prominently.

### User Story 2: David, 41, Software Engineer

David reads 2-3 books monthly across genres—sci-fi, business, history, literary fiction. Income ~$72K. Married, two kids. His problem: he'll finish a book and someone asks "Was it good?" and he can't articulate why he liked it beyond "Yeah, it was good." He's read 150+ books in past three years but remembers maybe 20 with any detail. He tried Goodreads reviews but writing paragraphs felt like homework he'd avoid. His library app shows he's read three books by the same author—he has no memory of whether he liked the first two.

**How Bookmark helps:** Journal's one-sentence feeling prompt is manageable. "Made me think about work differently." "Couldn't put down." "Beautiful world-building but slow." App uses these patterns to suggest books: "You've loved 6 books you described as 'couldn't put down'—try this." He builds useful reading memory without essay-writing.

**Design takeaway:** Emphasize "quick capture" language—this isn't a book report, it's memory insurance.

### User Story 3: Aisha, 29, Nonprofit Program Director

Aisha reads 4-5 books monthly, wants to read more diversely but algorithms trap her. Income ~$51K. Active in book club, follows book accounts. Her problem: she loves literary fiction but wants to try mystery, sci-fi, poetry—genres she hasn't explored since college. Amazon sees she rated literary fiction highly and only shows her more literary fiction. Goodreads "because you liked X" just shows similar books. She's stuck in a filter bubble. She'll ask friends for recommendations outside her usual but forgets to follow through.

**How Bookmark helps:** App's "Discovery Mode" intentionally shows books outside her usual genres but matching feeling/mood patterns from her literary fiction loves. "You loved books you described as 'beautiful sentences'—try this sci-fi novel readers describe the same way." Journal tracks her genre diversity over time, celebrates when she branches out. After 6 months, she's read across 8 genres, found new favorites.

**Design takeaway:** Make "breaking the bubble" feel like exploration, not algorithm manipulation—emphasize reader agency and curiosity.

### User Story 4: James, 38, High School Teacher

James reads 2-3 books monthly, summer reading jumps to 8-10/month. Income ~$54K. Book club member, recommends books to students. His problem: students ask for recommendations and he blanks on details—"There was this great book about… I can't remember the title." He's read incredible books but can't recall them when it matters. His Goodreads has dates and star ratings, nothing about why a book would work for specific students. He wants to be the teacher who gives perfect recommendations but his memory fails him.

**How Bookmark helps:** Journal's "Would recommend to:" prompt makes him think about audience while the book is fresh. "Students interested in social justice." "Readers who loved The Hate U Give." App makes these notes searchable. Student asks for something like THUG, he searches that phrase, finds 4 books with that tag. He becomes the teacher who remembers, because the system remembers for him.

**Design takeaway:** Search/filter functionality needs to be powerful but simple—readers should find past books instantly by feeling, audience, or comparison.

Should one side be app setup, reverse side be journal setup? Format: fold-out card, multi-panel, bookmark-style? Consider: QR codes for app download, visual quick-start.

**Option 5: Direct Mail Campaign Piece**
Targets lapsed readers who've tried Goodreads and quit. What mailing format breaks through (postcard, folded self-mailer, envelope)? Should "Can't remember the last great book you read?" be the hook? How feature journal + app integration in limited space? Call-to-action: buy journal, download app, visit website? Consider: personalization opportunity, dimensional mail.

**Option 6: Print Ad Series (Minimum 3 Ads)**
Where would these run? (Literary magazines, book review publications, New Yorker, airport magazine?) Sequential campaign or standalone messages? What hooks stop page-flippers—"Remember the feeling, not just the title"? How show physical + digital without looking complicated? Consider: One product per ad vs. integrated, testimonial-style vs. aspirational.

**Option 7: Bookstore Poster Series (3-5 Posters)**
Independent bookstore partnership—posters for stores that carry Bookmark. Informational (how it works) or emotional (why it matters)? How much copy vs. pure visual? Feature-specific posters ("Track Trusted Sources" / "Discover Outside the Algorithm" / "Remember What You've Read") or integrated message? Consider: frameable art quality, bookstore aesthetic alignment.

### Digital Deliverable Options (Choose 2, or 1 if Designing Physical Product)

**Physical Product Design: The Reading Journal (Counts as 1 Digital Deliverable)**
Design the actual journal as digital mockup. Dimensions (6"x8" suggested, but explore), cover material/finish, interior page layouts (Want to Read / Currently Reading / Completed sections), ribbon bookmark color, binding type. How does cover communicate "sophisticated tool for serious readers"? What interior typography makes quick-capture feel easy? Consider: Lay-flat binding requirement, cover debossing/foiling, paper quality signaling.

**Option 1: Mobile App Interface Design**

Consider: User-generated content opportunity, book club partnerships, author collaborations.

**Option 3: Website Landing Page**
Who's landing here—curious readers, Goodreads refugees, gift buyers? What see immediately—founder story, product demo, problem/solution? How prominently feature "physical + digital" integration? Conversion goal: buy journal, download app, email signup? Mobile-first or desktop-first? Consider: App store download buttons prominence, journal purchase path clarity, "How it works" video space.

**Option 4: Email Campaign Series (Minimum 3 Emails)**
Purpose: Onboarding new users (welcome + setup guidance + first week tips)? Re-engagement for dormant users? Feature education drip? How make helpful not preachy—"Here's how to…" vs "You should…"? Mobile-first design essential. Create emails readers want vs. delete immediately. Consider: Plain-text simplicity vs. designed template, personalization based on reading frequency.

**Option 5: Digital Advertising Campaign (Minimum 6 Ad Variations)**
Where run—Facebook/Instagram, podcast pre-roll display, book blog sidebar, Goodreads? Hook that stops scroll: "Still can't remember if you liked that author's other book?" Feature-specific ads (source tracking, discovery mode, memory prompts) or integrated message? Segment variations for different reader types? Consider: Video vs. static, testimonial vs. product-focused, retargeting vs. cold audience.

**Option 6: App Store Presence (Complete Listing)**
iOS App Store and/or Google Play. What makes download vs. scroll past? Screenshots showcase: dashboard, recommendation with reasoning, TBR management, source analysis, reading stats, journal integration. Which feature first—most impressive or most essential? App icon design, description copy (first 2 lines critical), feature bullets, ratings/reviews strategy. Consider: "Track Reading" is boring category, how differentiate, seasonal screenshots (summer reading, new year goals).

**Option 7: Animated Explainer Video Concept (Storyboard + Key Frames)**
Length (60 seconds recommended for social, 90-120 for website)? Animation style—hand-drawn warmth, clean motion graphics, hybrid live-action + animation? Narrative: problem/solution, day-in-life, founder story? How much time on features vs. emotional benefit? Consider: Voiceover tone (warm friend vs. sophisticated guide), music mood, ending CTA (download app, buy journal, learn more).

### Multi-Page Layout Options (Choose 1, Minimum 8 Pages/Slides)

**Option 1: Complete Reading Journal Interior (Cover + 8-12 Spreads)**
Design actual journal pages for production. Include: Introduction/how to use | Want to Read section (with prompts) | Currently Reading section (with progress tracking) | Completed section (with feeling capture) | Quarterly Reflection pages | Recommendation Source tracker | Reading Goals pages. Not blank notebook—guided experience with prompts. Typography hierarchy for scanning vs. deep reading.

Think holistically about integrated campaign across channels. Consider: Influencer partnerships, book club pilot program, author collaborations.

### Research Guidance

**Audience Research:**
Search: r/books, r/52weeksofbooks, r/suggestmeabook subreddits | #BookTok, #Bookstagram hashtags (watch what readers complain about) | Book podcast communities (What Should I Read Next, Currently Reading) | Goodreads reviews (look for frustration patterns).

Find: Language readers use about recommendations | What they say about Goodreads/Amazon (complaints about algorithms, review culture) | How they currently track TBR lists | What makes them trust a recommendation | Phrases about forgetting books they've read.

**Competitive Research:**
Research: Book recommendation apps (Goodreads, StoryGraph, Literal) | Reading tracker apps | Book journaling communities | Subscription book boxes | Library apps.

Analyze: Visual territory (lots of cozy/cute—how differentiate for sophisticated readers?) | Messaging approaches (feature-focused vs. benefit-focused) | What features do they emphasize? | Where do users complain in reviews? | Who does "physical + digital" integration well (in any category)?

**Visual Research:**
Look: Dribbble/Behance (search: reading app, book journal, recommendation engine) | Premium stationery brands (Moleskine, Leuchtturm1917, Baron Fig) | Literary magazine design | Independent bookstore branding | Book cover design trends.

Collect: Color palettes that feel literary not childish | Typography that's readable for long-form but distinctive | Journal layout systems (grid, prompts, white space) | Physical product photography (materials, textures, flat-lays).

**Market Research:**
Find statistics: How many books does average reader complete yearly | Reading app market size | Goodreads user satisfaction rates | E-book vs. physical book trends | Independent bookstore growth | Book podcast listener demographics.

Look: Pew Research Center (reading statistics) | Publishing industry reports | App Annie/Sensor Tower (book app downloads/revenue) | BookScan data (if accessible) | Surveys about reading habits post-pandemic.

### Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need from them:**

- Recommendation algorithm technical specs (how does it learn from journal entries?)
- App data structure (how are books, sources, moods, feelings stored/tagged?)
- Journal-to-app sync workflow (photo capture process, OCR capabilities?)
- Source tracking implementation (how does app analyze recommender success rates?)
- Discovery mode parameters (how does algorithm suggest outside filter bubble?)

**What they need from you:**

- Brand assets (logo files, color codes, typography specifications for app UI)
- UI design specifications (screen layouts, component library, interaction patterns)
- Iconography (for moods, genres, sources, features—consistent visual system)
- Copywriting (microcopy for prompts, error messages, empty states, onboarding)
- User flow priorities (which features are primary vs. secondary in navigation?)

**How to work together:**
Regular check-ins on technical constraints that affect design. Ask questions early about feasibility (Can journal sync work with handwriting? How accurate is mood pattern recognition?). Share work-in-progress for feedback. Be open to technical limitations requiring design adaptation. Explain design rationale (why sophisticated not cozy, why source tracking matters visually). They're building the engine, you're designing the experience—both essential.

### Final Reminders

This is not fill-in-the-blank work—creativity happens in how you interpret "sophisticated guide for readers." Book recommendation apps often look cozy-cute or corporate-sterile. Bookmark should feel like a tool for discerning readers who take their reading life seriously. Your unique value proposition is **capturing context and feeling so readers remember**, not just consuming content. Emphasize the physical + digital integration—this only works because handwriting improves memory and the app provides intelligence. Every design decision needs rationale. This is portfolio-worthy work that demonstrates you understand: brand positioning, designing for meaningful behavior change, physical + digital product ecosystems, and sophisticated design for intelligent audiences.

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this feel like a tool for serious readers or casual browsers?
- Am I showing how physical journal + app work together, not separately?
- Does "remember the feeling" come through in visual and verbal language?
- Would this make someone choose Bookmark over free Goodreads?
- Does the design respect readers' intelligence and time?

# PART 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

## Overview: Bridging Design to Development

This section provides technical implementation guidance for design students working on Bookmark. Understanding how your design decisions map to the underlying Recommendation Engine architecture ensures your creative vision can actually be built—and helps you create more sophisticated, implementation-aware design work.

Bookmark is one of several white-label configurations of the **Recommendation Engine Platform™**, a flexible preference-learning system built by programming students. Your design work will be implemented through configuration, theming, and feature toggles—not custom code.

**Key insight:** Bookmark uses the same database, recommendation logic, and core features as Atlas Travel Expenses™, EventFlow™, and other applications. What differentiates Bookmark is its literary voice, reading-focused features, memory capture emphasis, and brand identity designed for discerning readers seeking meaningful engagement with books.

-----

## 5.1 Engine Capability Mapping

**How Bookmark Features Map to Recommendation Engine Platform Capabilities**

The Recommendation Engine Platform provides a robust preference-learning system. Bookmark doesn't reinvent the wheel—it configures and brands existing capabilities with a literary, memory-focused approach.

### Items → Books

**Platform capability:** CRUD operations for items with attributes, categories, user ratings, and recommendation generation.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Item = **Book** (sophisticated, not "content" or "product")
- Standard item fields:
  - `title` → Book title
  - `creator` → Author
  - `item_type` → Format (hardcover, paperback, ebook, audiobook)
  - `description` → Synopsis/back cover text
  - `image_url` → Cover image
  - `external_id` → ISBN or Goodreads ID
- Additional metadata fields:
  - `page_count` (for reading progress)
  - `publication_year` (for discovery filtering)
  - `publisher` (optional context)
  - `language` (for multilingual readers)

**Design implications:**
- Book displays emphasize cover art (visual readers)
- Typography hierarchy: Title (largest), Author (prominent), Format/Pages (subtle)
- Cover images should be high-quality, prominent in all book displays
- Author name should be searchable and clickable (to find other books by author)
- Reading format (ebook vs. physical) displayed with appropriate iconography

### Ratings → Reading Experience

**Platform capability:** User ratings with numerical scale, written reviews, timestamps, and recommendation engine learning.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Rating = **Reading Experience** (not just stars, but feeling)
- Star rating (1-5, optional) labeled as "How much did you love it?"
- **One-sentence feeling** (text field, encouraged): "Beautiful sentences but slow" | "Couldn't put down" | "Made me think about work differently"
- **Who would love this?** (text field): "Readers who enjoyed [Book X]" | "Students interested in social justice"
- **Memorable moments** (optional extended notes)
- **Completion date** (when finished)
- **Reading duration** (calculated from start to finish date)

**Design implications:**
- Star rating de-emphasized (optional, not required)
- One-sentence feeling given visual prominence
- Prompt text should feel conversational: "What was the feeling this book gave you?"
- "Who would love this?" helps recommendation engine understand taste transfer
- Visual differentiation: completed books show feeling + stars, TBR shows anticipation/why added
- Reading experience forms should feel like capturing memory, not writing a review

### Attributes → Book Characteristics

**Platform capability:** Multi-valued attributes that categorize items, enable filtering, and power recommendation similarity matching.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Attributes = **Mood, Genre, Theme, Pacing, Style**
- **Mood tags:** atmospheric, cozy, dark, hopeful, intense, light, meditative, tense, uplifting, whimsical
- **Genre tags:** contemporary fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, literary fiction, memoir, mystery, non-fiction, poetry, romance, science fiction, thriller, young adult
- **Theme tags:** coming-of-age, family, friendship, grief, identity, love, politics, power, social justice, survival, technology, war
- **Pacing tags:** fast-paced, leisurely, medium
- **Style tags:** beautiful prose, character-driven, experimental, funny, lyrical, plot-driven, thought-provoking

**Design implications:**
- Mood tags use warm, sophisticated color palette (not primary colors)
- Genre tags feel literary, not commercial (avoid Amazon-style categorization)
- Tag selection interface should allow multiple selections (books can be multiple things)
- Tags should be searchable/filterable: "Show me atmospheric literary fiction"
- Visual language: tags as refined pills/badges, not shouty labels
- User-created tags encouraged with guidance ("What mood did this evoke?")

### Recommendations → "Your Next Read"

**Platform capability:** Algorithm generates personalized suggestions based on user ratings, attribute preferences, and similarity patterns.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Recommendation = **"Your Next Read"** or **"Try This Next"**
- Recommendation reasoning displayed: "You loved books you described as 'beautiful sentences'—readers describe this the same way"
- **Discovery Mode:** Intentionally suggests books outside usual genres but matching mood/feeling patterns
- **Source-aligned recommendations:** "Forever35 podcast recommended this—they have 85% hit rate for you"
- Recommendations include:
  - Book details (title, author, cover)
  - **Why this recommendation** (specific reason based on taste patterns)
  - **Confidence level** (high/medium/low based on pattern strength)
  - **Source attribution** (if from trusted source)
  - **Similar books you loved** (shows connection to past favorites)

**Design implications:**
- Recommendation cards show book cover prominently
- "Why" explanation given visual emphasis (not fine print)
- Confidence level displayed subtly (color-coded or icon-based)
- Discovery Mode recommendations visually distinct (different card style/color)
- Source attribution badge if recommendation from trusted source
- Easy actions: "Add to TBR," "Not Interested," "Already Read"
- Visual language: inviting exploration, not algorithmic pushy-ness

### Sources → Recommendation Sources

**Platform capability:** Track where items come from, analyze source reliability, filter by source.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Source = **Recommendation Source** (who/where you heard about this book)
- Source types:
  - **Friend** (with name: "Sarah," "Book Club Emily")
  - **Podcast** (with episode: "Forever35 Ep. 342")
  - **Social Media** (with account: "@readwithjenna Instagram")
  - **Book Club** (with group name: "Tuesday Night Book Club")
  - **Author** (recommended by another author)
  - **Publication** (New York Times, Literary Hub, etc.)
  - **Other** (user-defined)
- **Source hit rate tracking:** Shows percentage of recommendations from source that you loved
- **Source alignment score:** How well this source's taste matches yours

**Design implications:**
- Source tagging should be fast (dropdown + quick-add)
- Source names personal and specific (not generic categories)
- Source analysis screen shows list with hit rates (visual progress bars)
- High-performing sources highlighted (green indicator, star icon)
- Low-performing sources shown neutrally (no shame, just data)
- Visual language: "Sarah recommends books you love 85% of the time"
- Encourage source tracking: "Remember where you heard about this—it helps later"

### Wishlists → TBR (To Be Read) Lists

**Platform capability:** User-created lists to organize items, with notes and priorities.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- Wishlist = **TBR List** (To Be Read)
- Default TBR: "Want to Read" (main list)
- Custom TBRs encouraged: "Summer Reading," "Book Club Options," "Research for Novel," "Comfort Reads"
- Each TBR entry includes:
  - **Who recommended** (source)
  - **Why it sounds good** (user note)
  - **Mood tags** (what feeling you're seeking)
  - **Priority** (high/medium/low)
  - **Date added** (to track how long it's been waiting)

**Design implications:**
- TBR list feels welcoming, not overwhelming (even with 400 books)
- Sorting/filtering essential: by priority, date added, source, mood
- Visual indicators: books recommended by high-hit-rate sources highlighted
- "Why you added this" reminder shown when viewing book months later
- Easy re-prioritization (drag-and-drop or quick priority toggle)
- Visual language: aspirational shelf, not guilt-inducing backlog
- Empty state: "Your reading journey begins here—add your first book!"

### User Profiles → Reading Profiles

**Platform capability:** User accounts with preferences, reading history, and personalization settings.

**Bookmark mapping:**
- User = **Reader**
- Profile includes:
  - **Reading preferences:** Favorite genres, moods, themes
  - **Reading goals:** Books per month/year, genre diversity targets
  - **Trusted sources:** List of high-performing recommenders
  - **Reading pace:** Average pages per day (for time-to-finish estimates)
  - **Discovery settings:** How adventurous (stick to favorites vs. explore widely)
- **Reading stats:** Books completed, pages read, genre breakdown, reading streaks

**Design implications:**
- Profile feels personal, not data-driven
- Reading goals displayed aspirationally (mountain to climb, not judgment)
- Trusted sources section celebrates relationships ("These people know your taste")
- Reading pace non-judgmental (fast/medium/slow readers all valid)
- Stats celebrate reading life: "You've read 47 books this year across 12 genres!"
- Visual language: warm, encouraging, literary (not fitness tracker metrics)

## 5.2 Database Entity Alignment

**How Recommendation Engine Platform Database Entities Support Bookmark**

The platform uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema. Bookmark extends base entities with reading-specific fields and literary context.

### Users → Readers

**Base entity:** Standard user authentication and profile management.

**Bookmark extensions:**
- Additional profile fields:
  - `favorite_genres` (array: literary fiction, memoir, mystery, etc.)
  - `reading_goals_per_year` (integer: target book count)
  - `average_pages_per_day` (calculated from reading history)
  - `discovery_preference` (conservative, balanced, adventurous)
  - `preferred_formats` (physical, ebook, audiobook, mixed)
  - `time_available_daily` (minutes for reading—helps with recommendations)
- Links to **reading_sources** table (trusted recommenders)
- Links to **reading_goals** table (monthly/yearly targets)
- Links to **currently_reading** table (active book tracking)

**Design implications:**
- User profile emphasizes reading identity (genres loved, formats preferred)
- Onboarding flow asks about reading preferences in warm, conversational way
- Profile editing allows adjusting discovery preference as taste evolves
- Reading goals displayed with celebration (not pressure)

### Items → Books

**Base entity:** Items with title, creator, description, image, attributes.

**Bookmark terminology:**
- Item → **Book**
- Creator → **Author**
- Item type → **Format** (hardcover, paperback, ebook, audiobook)
- Additional fields:
  - `isbn` (for external integrations)
  - `goodreads_id` (for importing reviews/ratings)
  - `page_count` (for progress tracking)
  - `publication_year` (for filtering)
  - `publisher` (optional metadata)
  - `series_name` (if part of series)
  - `series_position` (Book 1, Book 2, etc.)

**Design implications:**
- Book cards prominently display cover, title, author
- Format indicated with subtle icon (book, screen, headphones)
- Series information shown for series books ("Book 2 in Mistborn Trilogy")
- ISBN/Goodreads links allow importing ratings from other platforms
- Page count used to estimate reading time ("~8 hours at your pace")

### Ratings → Reading Experiences

**Base entity:** User ratings with numerical score, review text, timestamp.

**Bookmark extensions:**
- Additional fields:
  - `one_sentence_feeling` (text, encouraged): core memory capture
  - `star_rating` (1-5, optional): de-emphasized in favor of feeling
  - `who_would_love_this` (text): recommendation-to-others prompt
  - `memorable_moments` (text, optional): extended notes/quotes
  - `reading_start_date` (when started)
  - `reading_finish_date` (when completed)
  - `reading_duration_days` (calculated)
  - `journal_photo_url` (photo of handwritten journal entry)
  - `reread` (boolean: is this a reread?)

**Design implications:**
- Reading experience form prioritizes one-sentence feeling (largest text field)
- Star rating optional, presented last (not first)
- "Who would love this?" feels conversational, not marketing-focused
- Journal photo upload celebrated ("Your handwritten memory, backed up forever")
- Reread indicator shows (with note: "Second read: even better this time")
- Visual hierarchy: feeling > context > stars

### Attributes → Book Characteristics

**Base entity:** Multi-valued attributes for categorization and filtering.

**Bookmark organization:**
- Attribute categories:
  - **Mood** (atmospheric, cozy, dark, hopeful, intense, etc.)
  - **Genre** (literary fiction, memoir, sci-fi, mystery, etc.)
  - **Theme** (family, identity, social justice, etc.)
  - **Pacing** (fast-paced, leisurely, medium)
  - **Style** (lyrical, plot-driven, character-driven, etc.)
- Each attribute has:
  - `attribute_name` (specific tag)
  - `attribute_category` (mood, genre, theme, pacing, style)
  - `color_code` (for visual consistency)
  - `user_created` (boolean: custom tag or system default)

**Design implications:**
- Mood tags use sophisticated color palette (muted, literary tones)
- Genre tags feel specific to readers (not Amazon marketing categories)
- Tag selection multi-select (books can have multiple moods/themes)
- User-created tags encouraged with suggested format
- Visual differentiation: mood tags warm colors, genre tags neutral, theme tags deep tones

### Recommendations → Reading Recommendations

**Base entity:** Personalized item suggestions based on user preferences and patterns.

**Bookmark enhancements:**
- Additional recommendation metadata:
  - `recommendation_reason` (text explaining why): "You loved books you described as 'beautiful prose'—readers describe this the same way"
  - `confidence_level` (high, medium, low based on pattern strength)
  - `source_aligned` (boolean: from a trusted high-hit-rate source)
  - `discovery_mode` (boolean: outside usual genres)
  - `similar_books_you_loved` (array: shows connection to past favorites)
  - `mood_match_score` (percentage)
  - `genre_match_score` (percentage)

**Design implications:**
- Recommendation cards show clear "why" explanation
- Confidence level indicated visually (filled stars, color intensity)
- Discovery recommendations visually distinct (special badge/color)
- Similar books shown as connection ("Like books X, Y, Z you loved")
- Easy dismissal ("Not interested") refines future recommendations
- Visual language: inviting, not pushy

### Sources → Recommendation Sources

**Base entity:** Track where items were discovered.

**Bookmark sophistication:**
- Source fields:
  - `source_name` (user-defined: "Sarah," "Forever35 Podcast," "@readwithjenna")
  - `source_type` (friend, podcast, social_media, book_club, publication, author, other)
  - `source_url` (optional: podcast episode link, Instagram post, article)
  - `source_notes` (optional: context like "met at book club")
  - `recommendations_count` (how many books from this source)
  - `hit_rate` (percentage of recommendations you loved)
  - `alignment_score` (0-100 based on taste matching)
  - `is_trusted` (boolean: user-marked as reliable)

**Design implications:**
- Source creation conversational ("Who recommended this book?")
- Source names personal, not generic ("Sarah" not "Friend #1")
- Hit rate displayed prominently (visual progress bar)
- High-performing sources celebrated (star badge, special color)
- Source analysis screen sortable by hit rate
- Visual language: "These are your trusted guides"

### Wishlists → TBR Lists

**Base entity:** User-created collections of items.

**Bookmark literary framing:**
- List fields:
  - `list_name` ("Want to Read," "Summer TBR," "Book Club Options")
  - `list_description` (optional context)
  - `is_default` (boolean: main TBR vs. custom lists)
  - `privacy_level` (private, friends, public)
  - `created_date`
- List item fields (books within TBR):
  - `book_id` (foreign key to items)
  - `source_id` (foreign key to sources—who recommended)
  - `why_added` (text: "Sounds like beautiful prose + family dynamics")
  - `mood_seeking` (array of mood tags)
  - `priority` (high, medium, low)
  - `date_added` (when added to TBR)

**Design implications:**
- Default TBR ("Want to Read") always visible
- Custom TBRs feel personal (user-named, color-coded)
- Book cards in TBR show "why you added this" reminder
- Sorting by priority, date added, source hit rate
- Visual aging: books added 6+ months ago gently highlighted ("Still interested?")
- Empty TBR: "Your next literary adventure awaits—add a book!"

### New Tables: Currently Reading, Reading Goals, Source Analysis

**Currently Reading table:**
```
currently_reading
├─ id (PK)
├─ user_id (FK → users)
├─ book_id (FK → items)
├─ start_date (date)
├─ current_page (integer)
├─ total_pages (integer from book)
├─ estimated_finish_date (calculated from reading pace)
├─ reading_notes (text: thoughts while reading)
├─ quotes (array: memorable passages)
└─ created_at (timestamp)
```

**Design implications:**
- Currently reading widget shows progress (% complete, pages remaining)

├─ target_value (integer)
├─ current_progress (integer)
├─ time_period (year, month, quarter)
├─ created_date (date)
└─ achieved (boolean)
```

**Design implications:**

- Multiple goal types supported (quantity, diversity, etc.)
- Achievement celebrated ("You read 50 books this year!")
- No shame for unmet goals—data for reflection

**Source Analysis table:**
```
source_analysis

- Visual ranking (high to low performers)
- Trusted sources marked with badge
- Easy to see "Forever35 = 85% hit rate, BookTok = 20% hit rate"

### How Developers Use This Configuration

**Terminology replacement throughout application:**

```python
# Example Flask template using configuration
from config import get_brand_config

config = get_brand_config('bookmark')

# In template:
<h1>{{ config.terminology.item_plural }}</h1>
# Renders: <h1>Books</h1>

# Mood tag selector:
<select name="mood_tags" multiple>
  {% for mood in config.default_mood_tags %}
    <option value="{{ mood.name }}" style="color: {{ mood.color }}">
      {{ mood.name }}
    </option>
  {% endfor %}
</select>
```

**Recommendation message rendering:**

```javascript
// Example React component using configuration
import brandConfig from '@/config/brands/bookmark.json';

function RecommendationCard({ book, reason, confidenceLevel, isDiscovery }) {
  const template = isDiscovery
    ? brandConfig.message_templates.discovery_recommendation
    : brandConfig.message_templates.high_confidence_recommendation;

  return (
    <div className="recommendation-card">
      <img src={book.cover_url} alt={book.title} />
      <h3>{book.title}</h3>
      <p className="author">{book.author}</p>
      <div className="reason">
        <Icon name={template.icon} />
        <p>{reason}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="actions">
        <button className="primary">Add to TBR</button>
        <button className="secondary">Not Interested</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Color theming via CSS variables:**

```css
/* Generated from Bookmark configuration */
:root {
  --color-primary: #5D4E37;
  --color-secondary: #8B7355;
  --color-accent: #D4A574;

### Component Library Expectations

Developers benefit from a **design system** documenting reusable components. Bookmark component library should include:

**Core Components:**

1. **Buttons**
   - Primary (main actions: "Add to TBR," "Complete Book")
   - Secondary (neutral actions: "Cancel," "Skip")
   - Success (positive actions: "Mark as Completed")
   - Sizes: small, medium, large
   - States: default, hover, active, disabled

2. **Cards**
   - Book card (cover, title, author, reading state)
   - Recommendation card (book + reason + confidence)
   - Source card (recommender + hit rate + books)
   - Reading experience card (feeling + stars + who would love)
   - States: default, selected, highlighted

3. **Tags/Badges**
   - Mood tags (atmospheric, cozy, dark, etc.)
   - Genre tags (literary fiction, mystery, etc.)
   - Theme tags (family, identity, etc.)
   - Source badges (trusted, high-performing)
   - Recommendation type badges (discovery, high-confidence)

4. **Form Elements**
   - Text inputs (book title, one-sentence feeling, who recommended)
   - Textareas (why added, memorable moments)
   - Dropdowns (source selection, mood selection)
   - Multi-select (genre tags, theme tags)
   - Star rating (optional, de-emphasized)
   - Date pickers (reading start/finish date)

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Reading progress (circular or linear progress bar)
   - Source hit rate (visual progress bars with percentages)
   - Reading stats (books per month, genre diversity charts)
   - Goal progress (visual milestones)
   - TBR aging indicator (subtle highlighting of old entries)

6. **Navigation**
   - Top navigation bar (Your Reading Life, Books, Recommendations, Sources, TBR, Profile)
   - Bottom tab bar (mobile: Home, TBR, Add Book, Recommendations, Profile)
   - Breadcrumbs (Books > Literary Fiction > Book Detail)

**Component Documentation Format:**

Each component documented with:
- **Visual example** (screenshot or live preview)
- **Usage guidelines** (when to use this component)

## 5.5 API Integration Points

**Where Design Touches Code: UI Components and Data Requirements**

Bookmark interface components consume data from backend APIs. Understanding these integration points helps designers create realistic, implementable interfaces.

### Dashboard Components and Data Requirements

**Dashboard:** Primary landing page showing reading life snapshot.

**Components:**

1. **Currently Reading Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/currently-reading`
   - **Response:** `{ book: {...}, start_date: "2026-01-01", current_page: 87, total_pages: 342, estimated_finish_date: "2026-01-15" }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time on progress update
   - **Design considerations:** Progress bar, estimated finish date, reading notes access

2. **TBR at a Glance**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/tbr/summary`
   - **Response:** `{ total_books: 47, high_priority: 8, recently_added: [...], aging_books: [...] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when TBR modified
   - **Design considerations:** Total count, priority breakdown, aging indicator for old entries

3. **Your Next Reads (Recommendations)**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/recommendations?limit=5`
   - **Response:** Array of recommendations with `{ book, reason, confidence_level, is_discovery, source_aligned, similar_books_you_loved }`
   - **Update frequency:** Daily refresh, real-time after completing book
   - **Design considerations:** Recommendation cards with reasoning, confidence indicators, discovery badges

4. **Recently Completed**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/books/completed?limit=5`
   - **Response:** Array of completed books with `{ book, completion_date, one_sentence_feeling, star_rating, who_would_love }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when book completed
   - **Design considerations:** Book covers, captured feeling prominently displayed

5. **Reading Goals**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/goals/current`
   - **Response:** `{ books_this_year: 42, goal: 50, percentage: 84, genre_diversity: 9, streak: 12 }`
   - **Update frequency:** Daily refresh
   - **Design considerations:** Progress visualization, genre diversity chart, encouraging language

6. **Trusted Sources**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/sources/trusted`
   - **Response:** Array of sources with `{ source_name, hit_rate, recommendations_count, last_recommendation }`
   - **Update frequency:** When source analysis updated
   - **Design considerations:** Source list with hit rates, visual ranking

**Loading states:** All dashboard components must handle:
- Initial load (skeleton screens with literary aesthetic)
- Empty state (no data yet: "Your reading journey begins here.")
- Error state (API failure: "We're having trouble loading your reading life. Tap to retry.")

### Book Addition Flow

**Add Book to TBR:** Critical user experience for capturing context.

**API endpoint:** `POST /api/books/tbr`

**Request payload:**
```json
{
  "book_id": 12847,
  "source_id": 3,
  "why_added": "Sounds like beautiful prose + family dynamics",
  "mood_seeking": ["atmospheric", "meditative"],
  "priority": "high",
  "date_added": "2026-01-15"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tbr_entry_id": 892,
  "created": true,
  "book": {
    "title": "The Remains of the Day",

# PART 6: CROSS-DISCIPLINE WORKFLOW

## Overview: How Design and Development Teams Collaborate

Bookmark succeeds through coordinated effort between design students (creating brand identity and user experience) and programming students (building the Recommendation Engine Platform). Neither discipline can work in isolation—designers need technical constraints, developers need visual specifications.

This collaboration mirrors real-world product development where designers and engineers must communicate across different professional languages and priorities.

-----

## Sprint-by-Sprint Collaboration Touchpoints

## Maintaining Literary Voice Throughout Collaboration

Bookmark uses a sophisticated, literary voice that contrasts with algorithmic recommendation platforms and cozy reading apps. Throughout collaboration, both designers and developers should maintain this distinction.

**Example email exchanges:**

**From designer to developer:**
> Subject: Question About Recommendation Reasoning Display
>
> Hey [Developer Name],
>
> I'm working on the recommendation feed design and want to make sure I'm presenting the reasoning in the most helpful way. A few questions:
>
> 1. What fields are available for recommendation reasoning? (Just text, or structured data like mood_match_score, similar_books, etc.?)
> 2. Can we show "similar books you loved" alongside the recommendation?
> 3. For Discovery Mode recommendations, do we have data on *why* it's outside usual genres but still a good match?
> 4. How is confidence level calculated? (Want to visualize it meaningfully, not just high/medium/low text)
>
> I'm aiming for recommendations that feel like a knowledgeable friend explaining why you'd love this book—not an algorithm pushing products. The reasoning should be the star, not buried in fine print.
>
> Let me know what's technically feasible! Happy to hop on a quick call if that's easier.
>
> Thanks!
> [Designer Name]

**From developer to designer:**
> Subject: RE: Question About Recommendation Reasoning Display
>
> Hey [Designer Name],
>
> Great questions! Here's what we can provide:
>
> 1. **Recommendation reasoning fields:**
>    - `reason` (text: e.g., "You loved books you described as 'beautiful prose'—readers describe this the same way")
>    - `confidence_level` (high, medium, low)
>    - `mood_match_score` (0-100 percentage)
>    - `genre_match_score` (0-100 percentage)
>    - `similar_books_you_loved` (array of book objects)
> 2. **Similar books:** Absolutely! We can show up to 3 books you loved that are similar to this recommendation.
> 3. **Discovery Mode reasoning:** Yes! We can explain specifically why it's outside usual genres (e.g., "This is science fiction, which you don't often read") AND why it's still a match (e.g., "but it matches your love of thought-provoking narratives").
> 4. **Confidence calculation:** Based on multiple factors (mood match strength, genre alignment, number of similar books you loved). We can expose mood/genre scores if you want to visualize those separately.
>
> Love the "knowledgeable friend" framing. That's exactly the vibe we're going for. Let me know if you need any sample data to design with.
>
> [Developer Name]

**Collaborative tone:**
- Respectful and professional
- Assumes good intent
- Asks clarifying questions
- Offers flexibility
- Celebrates shared goals
- Acknowledges constraints without blame

-----

**This collaboration is preparing both teams for real-world product development.**

In professional settings, designers and engineers must bridge communication gaps, negotiate constraints, and create products that serve real user needs. Bookmark teaches these skills while building genuinely useful tools for readers seeking meaningful engagement with books.

**The Algorithm is not involved in Bookmark. Jessica is. And she believes in the power of remembering.**

-----

**End of Document**

**This creative brief with technical implementation context bridges the gap between brand vision and platform reality. Use it to create a Bookmark that genuinely helps readers build meaningful memory—with sophistication, not simplification; with context, not consumption; with literary warmth, not algorithmic coldness.**

**Build something Jessica would be proud to share with her book club.**
