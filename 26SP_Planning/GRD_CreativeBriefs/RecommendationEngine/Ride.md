# CREATIVE BRIEF: RIDE

**Platform:** Recommendation Engine (Preference-Learning System)  
**White-Label Application:** Vehicle Comparison Shopping + Comparison Worksheet  
**Target Market:** Car shoppers navigating dealer pressure and feature overload

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **Ride**, a vehicle comparison platform that helps car shoppers track features across test drives and make confident decisions without dealer pressure. Unlike Consumer Reports data overload or dealer recommendations serving their commission, Ride gives buyers a systematic comparison tool that cuts through the noise and keeps them in control during the high-pressure buying process.

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines a **preference-learning app** with a **physical comparison worksheet pad**. The challenge is designing for buyers (first-time, upgrade, family car) who feel overwhelmed by choices, anxious about dealer manipulation, and can’t remember which features matter after test-driving multiple vehicles.

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 25-45 | Income $45K-$85K | Mix of first-time buyers and upgrade shoppers | Urban/suburban | Buying new or certified pre-owned | College-educated professionals

**Car Shopping Behavior:** Research online for weeks before visiting dealers | Test drive 3-6 vehicles before deciding | Use online calculators for payments | Read reviews obsessively | Ask friends for advice | Dread dealer interactions | Take 2-4 months from research to purchase

**Pain Points:**

- Dealer pressure makes them anxious—feel manipulated, rushed to decide
- Can’t remember which car had which features after test-driving 4 vehicles
- Sales pitch sounds great in dealership, fuzzy details later at home
- Features blur together (“Did the Honda have blind-spot monitoring or was that the Mazda?”)
- Worried about making expensive mistake (wrong car, bad deal, buyer’s remorse)
- Consumer Reports overwhelming—too much data, can’t apply to actual decision
- Car review sites are manufacturer-sponsored, can’t trust fully
- Comparison tools online don’t match real test drive experience
- Partners/family have different priorities, hard to compare notes

**Current Behavior:**

- Take photos of window stickers, lose track of which car
- Try to remember features mentally, details fade by evening
- Google “Honda CR-V vs Mazda CX-5” and read conflicting opinions
- Bring notebook to dealer, feel awkward writing while salesperson talks
- Revisit same dealers multiple times because forgot to check something
- Ask salesperson to repeat features (“Wait, does this have the safety package?”)
- Leave dealer feeling confused about what just happened
- Make spreadsheets at home with incomplete information

**What They Want:**

- Systematic way to compare vehicles without forgetting details
- Confidence standing up to dealer pressure with facts
- Remember which features matter to them (not salesperson priorities)
- Tool that works during test drive without seeming rude
- Clear comparison after visiting multiple dealers
- Make decision based on their priorities, not sales pitch

### Company Background: Founder Story

Alex was a software engineer shopping for a family SUV. Analytical by nature, he created a detailed spreadsheet: safety ratings, cargo space, fuel economy, tech features, price breakdowns. Spent three weekends test-driving vehicles at six dealerships.

By the fourth test drive, he couldn’t remember which features belonged to which car. The Subaru salesperson mentioned blind-spot monitoring—but wait, did the Honda have that too? He’d taken photos of window stickers but couldn’t match features to the actual driving experience. His spreadsheet at home was useless because he hadn’t filled it in during test drives—too awkward pulling out laptop while salesperson talked.

At the fifth dealer, high-pressure sales tactics hit. “This deal expires today.” “Another customer is interested.” “Let me talk to my manager.” Alex froze. He knew his spreadsheet had answers, but he couldn’t remember the data. He almost bought the wrong car because he couldn’t recall his own research under pressure.

He went home, refined his spreadsheet into a one-page comparison worksheet he could use during test drives. Printed it. Next dealership visit, he filled it in while sitting in the car, while salesperson talked, during the test drive. When pressure tactics started, he looked at his sheet: “I need to compare this to the other three vehicles. I’ll be in touch.” Confidence.

Three friends saw his worksheet and asked for copies. Then seven more. Then his entire office Slack channel.

*“Car buying is high-pressure and high-stakes. You need a system that keeps you in control when dealers are designed to take control away.”*

Ride became that system—an app that learns what matters to you and prompts the right questions, plus a physical worksheet for capturing details during dealer visits so you can compare clearly and decide confidently without pressure.

### Brand Positioning

**For** car shoppers ages 25-45 earning $45K-$85K who feel overwhelmed by vehicle choices and anxious about dealer pressure, **Ride** is a vehicle comparison system **that** helps you track features across test drives and make confident decisions based on your priorities—not sales tactics. **Unlike** Consumer Reports data overload or dealer recommendations serving their commission, **Ride** gives you a systematic comparison tool you can use during test drives to capture what actually matters, remember details across multiple vehicles, and stand up to pressure with facts.

- **Negotiate from knowledge:** “Your website showed $27,500 for this exact VIN”
- **Dealer can’t manipulate:** You have documented proof

### Why This Works When Others Don’t

**Consumer Reports:** Data overload, doesn’t match real test drive experience, ratings don’t map to your specific priorities, no capture tool for actual dealer visits, subscription paywall.

**Edmunds/Kelley Blue Book:** Helpful for research but useless during test drive, can’t customize to your needs, comparison tools are generic, no systematic capture method, manufacturer-influenced content.

**Dealer Recommendations:** Serving their commission not your needs, pressure tactics cloud judgment, forget details after leaving lot, biased toward inventory they have, “this car is perfect for you” means nothing without data.

**Car Review YouTube/Blogs:** Entertaining but not actionable, reviewer priorities ≠ your priorities, can’t remember details from 47-minute video, no systematic comparison, sponsored content everywhere.

**Your Own Notes/Photos:** Scattered across phone, can’t compare easily, forget context (“Why did I take this photo?”), no structure, lose track across multiple dealers, notes make no sense two weeks later.

**Ride Difference:** Systematic capture during the moment that matters (test drive), customized to YOUR priorities not generic ratings, physical tool that works when dealer pressure is highest, digital intelligence that builds comparison automatically. You control the process with facts, not feelings or sales tactics.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Maya, 28, Marketing Manager

Maya is buying her first new car after driving used Honda Civic for 8 years. Income ~$54K. Researched for 6 weeks, test-drove Mazda CX-30, Honda HR-V, Subaru Crosstrek, Toyota Corolla Cross. Her problem: by the fourth test drive, she couldn’t remember which features belonged to which car. Did the Mazda have heated seats standard or upgrade? Which one had the better blind-spot monitoring? She took photos of window stickers but couldn’t match them to how cars actually felt to drive. At Toyota dealer, salesperson pressured her: “This price expires today.” She panicked, couldn’t remember if other dealers offered better deals, almost signed because she couldn’t recall her own research.

**How Ride helps:** Before first test drive, app asks priority questions—she ranks safety tech first, fuel economy second, price third. App customizes worksheet. At each dealer, she fills in worksheet during test drive (checkmarks for features, notes on feel). After four test drives, app shows side-by-side: Crosstrek wins on safety tech (matches priority #1), Mazda wins on feel but missing key safety features. Decision clear: Crosstrek. She returns to Subaru dealer with worksheets showing competitor pricing, negotiates confidently.

**Design takeaway:** Worksheet must look professional enough to use openly at dealership without feeling awkward—this is a serious buyer doing research.

### User Story 2: James & Keisha, 34 & 36, Married Couple

Buying family SUV, need third row for two kids + grandparents. Combined income ~$92K. Their problem: James prioritizes safety and reliability, Keisha prioritizes space and tech features. They test-drove separately (different work schedules), couldn’t compare notes effectively. James came home saying “The Highlander felt solid,” Keisha said “But did it have the entertainment system for the kids?” Neither could remember specific details. They visited same dealers twice because they forgot to check different things. Dealer played them against each other: “Your husband seemed to like the Pilot better” (pressure tactic).

**How Ride helps:** They share one Ride account with same priority rankings (safety, space, budget agreed together). Both use same worksheet format at dealers. James fills out Highlander worksheet, Keisha fills out Pilot worksheet. That night, they lay worksheets side-by-side on table—same categories, easy to compare. App shows: Highlander wins safety, Pilot wins space, both equal on tech. They discuss priorities together with facts, not fuzzy memories. Decision made as team.

**Design takeaway:** System must support shared decision-making—multiple users, consistent comparison format, discussion-friendly physical worksheets.

### User Story 3: David, 41, Software Developer

Upgrading from sedan to truck for weekend projects and camping. Income ~$71K. Analytical personality, made detailed spreadsheet with 30 criteria. His problem: spreadsheet was useless at dealership—too awkward to fill in on laptop while salesperson talked, too many fields to remember. He’d test drive, come home, try to fill spreadsheet from memory, realize he forgot half the data. His spreadsheet became incomplete and therefore useless for comparison. After three dealers, he had inconsistent data—some trucks had all fields filled, others had gaps, couldn’t compare fairly.

**How Ride helps:** App takes his 30-criteria spreadsheet and condenses to 12 essential priorities. Worksheet is streamlined—one page, designed for in-the-moment capture. He fills it during test drive using clipboard. Salesperson sees him writing, treats him as serious buyer, answers questions thoroughly. After each visit, complete data. App builds the detailed comparison he wanted, but based on actual complete information not fuzzy memories. His analytical brain gets the systematic comparison it needs.

**Design takeaway:** Balance comprehensiveness with usability—too many fields = won’t get filled out, too few = can’t compare. Optimize for in-the-moment capture.

### User Story 4: Aisha, 30, Freelance Photographer

Buying reliable car for client meetings and gear hauling, replacing dying 2008 sedan. Income ~$48K, budget-conscious. Her problem: terrified of dealer pressure tactics after horror stories from friends. First dealer visit, salesperson used urgency: “Another buyer is interested in this one.” She felt heart racing, brain shut down, couldn’t think clearly. She left without buying but felt shaken. Scared to go back to dealers, but needs car soon. Online research helps but doesn’t prepare her for in-person pressure.

**How Ride helps:** App’s “Test Drive Prep” shows common pressure tactics for her shortlisted models and how to respond. “Another buyer interested” → “That’s fine, I’m comparing three vehicles this week.” Worksheet gives her script: “I need to review my comparison sheet and get back to you.” At dealer, when pressure starts, she literally looks at worksheet and says “I’m comparing this to two other vehicles. I’ll make my decision by Friday.” Physical tool in hand = confidence. Facts beat feelings. She test-drives three cars, compares systematically, decides without pressure. Returns to dealer with worksheet showing competitor pricing, negotiates fairly.

**Design takeaway:** Physical worksheet is psychological tool as much as data tool—gives buyers something to hold onto (literally) when pressure hits, creates excuse to slow down and think.

**Option 7: Dealership Partnership Materials (Co-Branded)**
For honest dealers who want to differentiate: “We welcome Ride users” signage, table tents saying “Take your time, use your comparison tool,” co-branded worksheets with dealer logo. How much Ride branding vs. dealer branding? Should materials include “No-pressure guarantee” messaging? Consider: Dealer recruitment package, mutual benefit positioning (serious buyers = better customers), certification program (“Ride-Friendly Dealer”).

### Digital Deliverable Options (Choose 2, or 1 if Designing Physical Product)

**Physical Product Design: The Smart Scanner Key Fob (Counts as 1 Digital Deliverable)**

**Option 6: App Store Presence (Complete Listing)**
iOS/Google Play. What makes download vs. scroll? Screenshots: Priority builder quiz, shortlist with specs, test drive prep checklist, comparison view side-by-side, decision recommendation with reasoning, worksheet photo-capture. Which feature first: most unique (priority builder) or most needed (comparison)? App icon, description copy (first 2 lines: “Car shopping without the pressure” or “Compare vehicles clearly, decide confidently”). Consider: “Auto & Vehicles” category is crowded with dealer apps, differentiate as buyer-advocate tool.

**Option 7: Video Explainer Series (3 Videos)**
Video 1 (60 sec): Before You Shop - Setting priorities, building shortlist, preparing questions  
Video 2 (90 sec): At the Dealer - Using worksheet during test drive, handling pressure, capturing details  
Video 3 (60 sec): Making the Decision - Comparing vehicles, using app’s recommendation, negotiating confidently

Research: Car comparison sites (Edmunds, KBB, Cars.com, TrueCar) | Consumer Reports | Car buying apps | Budgeting tools | Dealer review platforms.

Analyze: Visual territory (data-heavy, overwhelming—differentiate with clarity?) | What features emphasized? | Where do comparison tools fail? | What makes buyers trust a tool? | User complaints in app reviews.

**Visual Research:**
Look: Dribbble/Behance (search: comparison tool, decision app, automotive, worksheet design) | Financial planning tools (systematic comparison aesthetic) | Professional forms | Automotive brand design (confident not flashy).

Collect: Color palettes that feel confident and professional | Typography for data clarity and handwriting-friendly forms | Layout systems for comparison | Iconography for vehicle features.

**Market Research:**
Find statistics: Annual car sales (new/used) | Average time to buy | Buyer anxiety and regret rates | Dealer satisfaction scores | First-time buyer demographics | Trade-in vs. purchase behavior.

Look: NADA data | Edmunds buyer behavior research | Consumer Reports car buying surveys | JD Power studies | Academic research on decision-making under pressure.

### Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need from them:**

- Browser extension development (which browsers supported? Chrome/Firefox/Safari? Data scraping from listing sites—legal/technical limitations?)
- OCR technology specs (how accurate is document scanning from fob camera? Optimal lighting/distance? Which fonts/formats can it read reliably?)
- Key fob hardware (camera quality needed for Monroney label capture? Bluetooth range/pairing process? Battery life with typical usage? LED indicator programming?)
- Cross-reference algorithm (how does app match online listing to scanned dealer data? VIN matching priority? Fuzzy matching for similar vehicles?)
- Financing calculator API (where does app pull credit union/bank rates? Real-time or database? User credit score integration options?)

**What they need from you:**

- Brand assets (logo, color codes, typography specs for app, extension, and device branding)
- Industrial design specs for fob (device dimensions, button placement, LED indicators, camera lens position, keychain attachment)
- Browser extension UI design (toolbar icon, popup interface, data capture confirmation screens)
- App UI design specs (screen layouts, alert system design, comparison view, financing calculator interface, component library)
- Iconography (alert symbols—red warnings/green matches, priority categories, feature types, vehicle categories, financing comparison visuals)
- Microcopy (browser extension prompts, fob sync confirmations, cross-reference alert text, financing savings messaging, dealer pressure responses)

**How to work together:**
Regular check-ins about technical constraints. Ask early about feasibility (Can browser extension scrape all listing sites legally? Can fob camera really read Monroney labels in outdoor lighting? How accurate is cross-reference matching? Can financing calculator pull real-time rates?). Share WIP for feedback. Be open to technical limitations requiring design adaptation (maybe some listing sites block scraping, maybe OCR needs optimal lighting conditions, maybe some credit unions don’t share rate APIs). Explain rationale (why browser extension needs one-click simplicity, why fob must be pocket-sized for keychain, why cross-reference alerts must be prominent not buried, why financing savings must show total dollars not just APR difference). They’re building dealer protection intelligence, you’re designing buyer confidence system—both essential for protecting car shoppers from manipulation.

### Final Reminders

This is not fill-in-the-blank work—creativity happens in how you interpret “confident straight-shooter cutting through BS.” Car buying tools often look corporate-boring (Consumer Reports) or salesy-sketchy (dealer sites). Ride should feel like smart friend giving you the protection system to stay in control. Your unique value proposition is **automatic data capture (browser extension + key fob scanner) combined with cross-reference alerts and financing comparison to protect buyers from dealer manipulation**—not generic ratings, not opinions, not manual worksheets. Emphasize the complete system working together: extension captures online promises → fob verifies dealer reality → app alerts to discrepancies → financing calculator exposes overpriced dealer loans. Every design decision needs rationale. This is portfolio-worthy work demonstrating: brand positioning for consumer protection, designing IoT product + browser tool + mobile app ecosystem, anti-manipulation advocacy design, confidence-building through automated verification.

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this feel like buyer protection technology or just another comparison app?
- Am I showing how browser extension + fob + app work together seamlessly (not three separate products)?
- Do the cross-reference alerts clearly expose dealer manipulation tactics?
- Does the financing calculator make dealer loan costs immediately obvious?
- Would an anxious first-time buyer trust this system to protect them from getting ripped off?
- Does the design empower buyers to negotiate from knowledge, not pressure?
