## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **Ride**, a vehicle comparison platform that helps car shoppers track features across test drives and make confident decisions without dealer pressure. Unlike Consumer Reports data overload or dealer recommendations serving their commission, Ride gives buyers a systematic comparison tool that cuts through the noise and keeps them in control during the high-pressure buying process.

**The Complete System**: Ride combines three components working together:
- **Smart Scanner Key Fob** (keychain-sized device with built-in camera, scans vehicle window stickers/spec sheets at dealerships)
- **Browser Extension** (one-click capture of online car listings during research phase)
- **Mobile App** (comparison engine, cross-reference alerts, financing calculator, decision helper)

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines IoT hardware, browser tool, and mobile app. The challenge is designing for buyers (first-time, upgrade, family car) who feel overwhelmed by choices, anxious about dealer manipulation, and can't remember which features matter after test-driving multiple vehicles.

> **DESIGN CHALLENGE #1**: How do you design a THREE-component ecosystem (fob + extension + app) that feels like ONE unified buyer protection system, not three separate products?

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 25-45 | Income $45K-$85K | Mix of first-time buyers and upgrade shoppers | Urban/suburban | Buying new or certified pre-owned | College-educated professionals

**Car Shopping Behavior:** Research online for weeks before visiting dealers | Test drive 3-6 vehicles before deciding | Use online calculators for payments | Read reviews obsessively | Ask friends for advice | Dread dealer interactions | Take 2-4 months from research to purchase

**Pain Points:**

- Dealer pressure makes them anxious—feel manipulated, rushed to decide
- Can't remember which car had which features after test-driving 4 vehicles
- Sales pitch sounds great in dealership, fuzzy details later at home
- Features blur together ("Did the Honda have blind-spot monitoring or was that the Mazda?")
- Worried about making expensive mistake (wrong car, bad deal, buyer's remorse)
- Consumer Reports overwhelming—too much data, can't apply to actual decision
- Car review sites are manufacturer-sponsored, can't trust fully
- Comparison tools online don't match real test drive experience
- Partners/family have different priorities, hard to compare notes

**What They Want:**

- Systematic way to compare vehicles without forgetting details
- Confidence standing up to dealer pressure with facts
- Remember which features matter to them (not salesperson priorities)
- Tool that works during test drive without seeming rude
- Clear comparison after visiting multiple dealers
- Make decision based on their priorities, not sales pitch

### Company Background: Founder Story

Alex was a software engineer shopping for a family SUV. Analytical by nature, he created a detailed spreadsheet: safety ratings, cargo space, fuel economy, tech features, price breakdowns. Spent three weekends test-driving vehicles at six dealerships.

By the fourth test drive, he couldn't remember which features belonged to which car. The Subaru salesperson mentioned blind-spot monitoring—but wait, did the Honda have that too? He'd taken photos of window stickers but couldn't match features to the actual driving experience. His spreadsheet at home was useless because he hadn't filled it in during test drives—too awkward pulling out laptop while salesperson talked.

At the fifth dealer, high-pressure sales tactics hit. "This deal expires today." "Another customer is interested." "Let me talk to my manager." Alex froze. He knew his spreadsheet had answers, but he couldn't remember the data. He almost bought the wrong car because he couldn't recall his own research under pressure.

He went home, refined his spreadsheet into a one-page comparison worksheet he could use during test drives. Printed it. Next dealership visit, he filled it in while sitting in the car, while salesperson talked, during the test drive. When pressure tactics started, he looked at his sheet: "I need to compare this to the other three vehicles. I'll be in touch." Confidence.

Three friends saw his worksheet and asked for copies. Then seven more. Then his entire office Slack channel.

*"Car buying is high-pressure and high-stakes. You need a system that keeps you in control when dealers are designed to take control away."*

Ride became that system—a smart scanner key fob that captures dealer data instantly, a browser extension that documents online promises, and an app that cross-references everything so dealers can't manipulate you with bait-and-switch tactics or hidden financing costs.

### Brand Positioning

**For** car shoppers ages 25-45 earning $45K-$85K who feel overwhelmed by vehicle choices and anxious about dealer pressure, **Ride** is a vehicle comparison system **that** helps you track features across test drives and make confident decisions based on your priorities—not sales tactics. **Unlike** Consumer Reports data overload or dealer recommendations serving their commission, **Ride** gives you automatic data capture (scan window stickers, save online listings), cross-reference alerts (exposing dealer bait-and-switch), and financing comparison (revealing overpriced dealer loans)—systematic buyer protection when you need it most.

### Key Brand Messages

**Primary Message:** Your priorities, your decision, your control.

**Supporting Messages:**

- Scan window stickers, capture online listings, compare systematically | No more "which car had what?"
- Cross-reference alerts expose dealer manipulation | Bait-and-switch protection built in
- Financing calculator shows dealer loan markup | Save thousands with one tap
- Built by someone who survived the process, refined by hundreds of buyers

### Pricing & Business Model Context

**Smart Scanner Key Fob:**
- Standard pricing: $59-79 one-time purchase
- Premium positioning: Professional buyer protection tool, not toy
- Includes: USB-C charging cable, quick-start guide, 1-month premium app trial

**App Subscription Model:**
- Free tier: Basic comparison (3 vehicles max, manual entry only)
- Premium: $6.99/month or $49/year (unlimited vehicles, fob sync, cross-reference alerts, financing calculator, dealer reviews)

**Browser Extension:**
- Always free (captures online listings, builds shortlist)
- Gateway to app ecosystem

**Revenue Model:**
- Device sales (one-time)
- Premium app subscriptions (recurring)
- Honest dealer partnerships (certified dealerships pay for "Ride-Friendly" designation)
- Anonymized car shopping data insights (sold to consumer advocates, not manufacturers)

**Design Implication**: This is buyer-advocate technology. Design should communicate "on your side against dealer manipulation," not neutral comparison tool. Think consumer protection agency, not car magazine.

### Privacy & Data Ownership

**What Ride Captures:**
- VINs from scanned window stickers (to match dealer car to online listing)
- Dealer visit locations and timestamps (to track your shopping journey)
- Financing offers from dealers (to compare against market rates)
- Browser history of car listings (which cars you researched online)
- Test drive notes (your personal impressions)

**Privacy Protections:**
- **Your data, your ownership:** Ride stores for YOUR benefit, never sells to dealers or manufacturers
- **Optional aggregation:** You can opt-in to anonymous market insights (helps other buyers, pressures dealers to be honest)
- **Dealer-blind:** Dealers can't see that you're using Ride scanner (looks like you're checking your keys)
- **Export and delete:** Download complete shopping history, delete account = permanent deletion
- **No social pressure:** Your car shopping is private, not broadcast to friends

**Critical Messaging:**
"Ride is on YOUR side. We protect buyers from dealer manipulation. We NEVER sell your data to dealers or manufacturers."

**Design Implications:**
- Privacy controls prominent in app settings
- Scanner fob designed to look like normal key fob (stealth at dealerships)
- Cross-reference alerts emphasize "protecting you" not "catching dealers lying"
- Visual language: advocate, protector, ally (NOT neutral tool, NOT dealer-friendly)

### Required Deliverables

**All students must create:**

1. **Brand Identity System** (logo, wordmark/logomark, color palette, typography hierarchy)
2. **Brand Style Guide** (2-3 pages: logo usage, colors, typography, voice/tone, visual examples)

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What Ride Is

A vehicle comparison platform that helps you define what matters (safety, space, tech, budget), track those priorities across multiple test drives, and compare vehicles systematically so you can make confident decisions without dealer pressure. Unlike review sites giving opinions or data sites overwhelming with specs, Ride focuses on YOUR priorities and captures details in the moment—during test drives when information is fresh and dealers are watching.

The system works in three phases: **Research** (browser extension captures online listings) → **Dealers** (key fob scans window stickers) → **Decision** (app cross-references and compares).

### TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY NOTE (OOC)

**For students**: The technologies described here (OCR scanning, web scraping, cross-reference matching) represent an *idealized* system for creative purposes. Real-world implementation would face:

**OCR Challenges:**
- Monroney labels (window stickers) have standardized formats, BUT outdoor lighting, reflections, and camera angles affect accuracy
- Accuracy might be 80-90% not 100% (price $27,499 might scan as $27,999)
- Students should design error correction flows ("Does this look right?")

**Web Scraping Limitations:**
- Many car listing sites actively block automated scraping
- Legal gray area (scraping public data vs. violating terms of service)
- Sites change layouts frequently (extension breaks, requires updates)

**Cross-Reference Matching:**
- Matching online listing to dealer car requires VIN or fuzzy matching (make/model/year/trim)
- False positives possible ("This might be the same car" vs. "This is definitely the same car")

**Financing API Reality:**
- Most credit unions/banks don't offer public APIs for real-time rates
- Ride would need partnerships or manual user entry
- Legal liability if calculator shows wrong rates

**Your design work should:**
- Present this as aspirational buyer protection system (what if this worked perfectly?)
- Design error states and confirmation flows (scanner: "Did this capture correctly?")
- Acknowledge limitations in UI copy ("Estimated savings based on typical rates")
- Focus on user experience of having protection tool, even if tech isn't perfect

Think: Amazon's price tracker (sometimes inaccurate but still useful), Honey coupon finder (doesn't work on every site but helps when it does).

**Design accordingly**: Your marketing should emphasize "helps you compare" and "alerts you to discrepancies" without promising "catches every dealer lie" (legal liability).

### Physical Component: Smart Scanner Key Fob

**Format:** Keychain-sized device (approximately 2" x 1" x 0.5") | Built-in camera scanner | Single button operation | LED indicator lights | Rechargeable via USB-C | Durable construction for daily keychain carry

**Base Product Reference:** Similar form factor to car key fobs, Tile trackers, hotel key cards (students can reference existing products)

**Fictitious Smart Features (The "Magic"):**

- **Multi-Format Scanning:** Camera reads QR codes (dealer window stickers) | OCR captures text from printed window stickers (Monroney labels) | Scans dealer spec sheets/printouts | Can photograph online listings shown on dealer computer screens
- **Automatic Data Extraction:** Pulls from scanned documents: Make/Model/Trim/Year | VIN | MSRP and dealer price | Complete features list | MPG ratings | Engine specs | Safety features | Tech package details | Options/add-ons
- **Bluetooth Sync:** Press button after scan → LED blinks (confirming capture) → Auto-syncs to Ride app on phone | Can scan 5-6 cars per dealer visit, all stored separately | Works offline (syncs when back in phone range)
- **Cross-Reference Intelligence:** Matches scanned dealer data against online listings saved via browser extension | Alerts to price increases, missing features, trim differences, bait-and-switch attempts

**Physical Design Considerations:**

- **Compact keychain design** (always with you, attached to car keys)
- **Single-button operation** (point camera at document, press button, done—no menus, no complexity)
- **LED indicator lights** (scanning/synced/battery low/error states—must be visible in outdoor dealer lots)
- **Rechargeable battery** (USB-C charging, 2-week battery life per charge with typical use)
- **Durable materials** (drop-resistant for dealer lot use, weather-resistant, pocket-friendly)
- **Camera lens** (optimized for document capture in various lighting—outdoor lots, showroom fluorescents)
- **Ride branding** (subtle logo, premium finish—looks professional not toy)
- **Stealth factor** (looks like normal key fob, doesn't advertise "I'm scanning your window sticker")

**Why Smart Scanner Key Fob Works:**

- Eliminates manual data entry (5 seconds to scan vs. 5 minutes to type all features)
- Captures perfect data from source documents (no typos, no forgotten details)
- Fast and discreet (dealer thinks you're checking your keys, you're actually scanning their data)
- Works with ANY dealer (window stickers are federally required, standardized format)
- Portable (on keychain, always available when you need it)
- Professional appearance (serious buyer tool, shows you're prepared)
- Protects against dealer manipulation (documented proof of what was displayed/promised)

> **DESIGN CHALLENGE #2**: How do you make a camera-equipped scanning device feel like buyer protection (empowering) not surveillance/espionage (creepy or confrontational with dealers)?

**Note**: Remaining sections follow established pattern but adapted for Ride context:
- User stories (Maya first-time buyer, James & Keisha couple, David analytical, Aisha anxious about pressure)
- Print/Digital/Multi-page deliverables with vehicle shopping focus
- Research guidance for car buying audience
- Collaboration with programming students on OCR/scraping/APIs
- Portfolio value and final reminders

**Critical differentiation from Bookmark/LetsEat:**
- THREE-component ecosystem (not just physical + digital)
- Adversarial positioning (protecting buyers FROM dealers, not neutral tool)
- Legal/ethical considerations (exposing dealer manipulation, financing comparison liability)
- Hardware + browser tool + mobile app industrial design complexity
