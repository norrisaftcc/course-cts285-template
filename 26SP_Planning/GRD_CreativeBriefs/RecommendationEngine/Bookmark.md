# CREATIVE BRIEF: BOOKMARK

**Platform:** Recommendation Engine (Preference-Learning System)  
**White-Label Application:** Book Recommendations + Reading Journal  
**Target Market:** Regular readers seeking better discovery and reading memory

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

Design a complete brand identity and marketing system for **Bookmark**, a book recommendation platform that helps readers remember why they wanted to read something and how it made them feel. Unlike algorithmic recommendation services that trap readers in filter bubbles, Bookmark captures the context around reading—who recommended it, what mood you were seeking, the feeling it gave you—so readers build a meaningful relationship with their reading life instead of just consuming and forgetting.

Students will create white-label branding for a recommendation engine platform that combines a **preference-learning app** with a **physical reading journal**. The challenge is designing for readers who love books but struggle to remember what they’ve read, why they added books to their TBR list, and whether recommendations from various sources actually match their taste.

### Target Audience

**Demographics:** Ages 28-45 | Income $45K-$80K | College-educated | Urban/suburban | Professional careers

**Reading Behavior:** 2-5 books per month | Cross-genre readers | Active TBR list management | Follow book recommendations from multiple sources (podcasts, friends, social media, book clubs)

**Pain Points:**

- Can’t remember books they’ve read or how they felt about them
- Lose track of why they added books to TBR lists
- Can’t recall if they’ve read other books by an author
- Screenshot recommendations then forget context (who suggested it, why it sounded good)
- Goodreads feels like homework | Amazon shows same recommendations repeatedly
- Want to discover new genres but algorithms keep them in familiar territory

**Current Behavior:**

- Keep sprawling TBR lists in Notes app, Goodreads, screenshots
- Star-rate books with no context for future reference
- Rely on memory (which fails) to track reading preferences
- Trust recommendations from friends/podcasts but lose track of sources
- Want structured tracking but journaling attempts feel like work

**What They Want:**

- Remember the **feeling** books gave them, not just plot details
- Track **who** recommended books and whether their taste aligns
- Quick-capture system that doesn’t feel like homework
- Discover books outside algorithm bubbles
- Build reading history they can actually reference

### Company Background: Founder Story

Jessica had read 200+ books in four years but couldn’t remember half of them. She’d pick up an author’s newest release and realize halfway through she’d already read their previous book—couldn’t remember if she’d liked it. Her Goodreads was full of 4-star ratings with no context. Amazon kept recommending the same thrillers. She’d screenshot book recommendations from podcasts, Instagram, friends’ texts, then forget where she’d seen them or why they sounded compelling.

At book club, someone asked “What’s the best book you’ve read this year?” She froze. Forty-seven books that year. Couldn’t pick one—not because they were all equal, but because she couldn’t remember the **feeling** they gave her.

Goodreads reviews felt like homework. Notes app was chaos. Reading journal attempts failed because she didn’t want to write essays.

She started using physical bookmarks and writing on them: book title, date finished, one sentence about the feeling, who recommended it. Simple. It worked. Friends saw her bookmark collection and wanted the system.

*“You don’t need to remember everything about a book. You need to remember how it made you feel and whether to trust the person who recommended it.”*

Bookmark became that system—digital app for discovery and recommendations, physical journal for memory and reflection, both working together so readers build a reading life they actually remember.

### Brand Positioning

**For** regular readers ages 28-45 who consume 2-5 books monthly but struggle to remember what they’ve read and why they wanted to read it, **Bookmark** is a book recommendation system **that** captures the context and feeling around reading so you build meaningful memory instead of just consuming content. **Unlike** Goodreads, Amazon, and algorithm-driven platforms that trap you in filter bubbles and reduce books to star ratings, **Bookmark** tracks why you wanted to read something, how it made you feel, and whose recommendations actually match your taste—creating a reading archive that serves your curiosity, not corporate algorithms.

### Key Brand Messages

**Primary Message:** Remember the feeling, not just the title.

**Supporting Messages:**

- Your reading life deserves better than star ratings and forgotten screenshots
- Discover books outside the algorithm bubble | Track recommendations from trusted sources
- Quick capture that doesn’t feel like homework | Reading journal meets recommendation engine

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What Bookmark Is

A recommendation engine that learns your reading preferences and suggests books based on patterns in what you’ve loved—but unlike algorithmic platforms, Bookmark captures **context** (who recommended it, why you added it, what mood you were seeking) and **feeling** (emotional response, memorable moments, who else would love it). The system includes a **preference-learning app** and **physical reading journal** that work together to build reading memory.

### Physical Component: Reading Journal

**Format:** Hardcover journal (approximately 6”x8”) | 200+ pages | Ribbon bookmark | Lay-flat binding

**Structure:**

- **Want to Read** section: Title | Author | Who recommended it | Why it sounds good | Mood/genre tags | Date added
- **Currently Reading** section: Start date | Page tracker | Thoughts while reading | Quotes worth saving
- **Completed** section: Finish date | One-sentence feeling | Star rating | Would recommend to (who?) | What to read next based on this

**Key Features:**

- **Quick-capture format** (fill-in-the-blank prompts, not essay prompts)
- **Recommendation source tracking** (friend name, podcast episode, Instagram account, book club)
- **Mood/feeling emphasis** (not just genre categorization)
- **Reading patterns over time** (quarterly reflection pages to see patterns)

**Why Physical Journal Matters:**

- Writing by hand improves memory retention
- No screen fatigue | Tangible archive of reading life
- Can be used without phone/app (bedside, coffee shop, waiting room)
- Premium object that honors reading as valued activity

### Digital Component: Recommendation App

**Core Features:**

- **Smart TBR Management:** Import from screenshots, podcasts, social media | Tag by mood/genre/source | Sort by priority/added date
- **Reading Tracker:** Currently reading progress | Time-to-finish estimates | Reading streak tracking
- **Recommendation Engine:** Learns from completed books, mood patterns, trusted sources | Suggests books outside filter bubble | “If you loved X, try Y because [specific reason]”
- **Source Analysis:** Tracks which recommenders have highest hit rate for you | Shows alignment percentage with your taste
- **Memory Prompts:** “You finished this 6 months ago—remember how you felt?” | “You added this because [saved reason]”
- **Discovery Mode:** Intentionally shows books outside your usual genres based on feeling/mood match

**Advanced Features:**

- **Reading Goals:** Monthly/yearly targets | Genre diversity tracking | Reading time analytics
- **Journal Sync:** Photo-capture journal pages | Digital backup of handwritten notes
- **Social (Optional):** Share recommendations with trusted circle | Private book club groups | No public reviews/ratings
- **Library Integration:** Check availability at local libraries | Indie bookstore partnership links

### How Physical + Digital Work Together

**Before Reading:**

- **App:** Add book to TBR with context (who recommended, why, mood tags)
- **Journal:** Write it in “Want to Read” with personal note about appeal

**During Reading:**

- **App:** Track progress, time reading, receive prompts
- **Journal:** Capture quotes, thoughts, memorable moments by hand

**After Reading:**

- **Journal:** Write one-sentence feeling, star rating, who’d love it
- **App:** Photo-capture journal entry, feeds recommendation engine
- **System learns:** Your taste, which sources to trust, which moods lead to loved books

**Recommendation Flow:**

- App suggests books based on feeling/mood patterns from journal entries
- Shows “You loved [Book A] because ‘beautiful sentences’—try [Book B], readers describe it the same way”
- Tracks whether recommendations hit or miss, adjusts future suggestions

### Why This Works When Others Don’t

**Goodreads:** Public performance, star ratings without context, algorithm serves Amazon not readers, reviews from strangers with unknown taste alignment.

**Amazon:** Recommendation engine optimized for sales not reading satisfaction, filter bubble traps you in similar books, no source tracking, no feeling/mood capture.

**StoryGraph:** Better mood tracking but purely digital (no memory benefits of handwriting), limited source attribution, recommendation algorithm still opaque.

**BookTok/Bookstagram:** Hype-driven, no personalization, recommendations disappear in feed, can’t track which influencers match your taste.

**Personal Systems (Notes App/Spreadsheets):** No recommendation engine, purely manual, screenshots get lost, no pattern recognition across books.

**Bookmark Difference:** Combines analog memory benefits (handwriting, physical archive) with digital intelligence (pattern recognition, source analysis, discovery algorithms that serve readers not platforms). Captures **why** you wanted to read something so you make better decisions about **what** to read next.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Maya, 32, Marketing Manager

Maya reads 3-4 books monthly, mostly contemporary fiction and memoirs. Income ~$58K. Commutes via train, reads before bed. Her problem: she screenshots book recommendations from podcasts and Instagram, then forgets which episode or account suggested them. Her camera roll has 200+ book screenshots with zero context. She’ll buy a book months later because the cover looks familiar, not remembering if the source was trustworthy. Her “system” is chaos—Goodreads TBR has 400 books, no priority order, no memory of why she added them. She wishes she could remember who recommended books that became favorites so she could trust that source again.

**How Bookmark helps:** App lets her tag screenshots with source while saving them. Journal tracks which podcast hosts’ recommendations hit vs. miss. After 3 months, she sees that “Forever35” podcast has 85% hit rate while BookTok account has 20%. She trusts the data, focuses on high-value sources, stops wasting time on hyped books that aren’t for her.

**Design takeaway:** Visual system needs to make source tracking feel essential, not extra work—show success rate of recommenders prominently.

### User Story 2: David, 41, Software Engineer

David reads 2-3 books monthly across genres—sci-fi, business, history, literary fiction. Income ~$72K. Married, two kids. His problem: he’ll finish a book and someone asks “Was it good?” and he can’t articulate why he liked it beyond “Yeah, it was good.” He’s read 150+ books in past three years but remembers maybe 20 with any detail. He tried Goodreads reviews but writing paragraphs felt like homework he’d avoid. His library app shows he’s read three books by the same author—he has no memory of whether he liked the first two.

**How Bookmark helps:** Journal’s one-sentence feeling prompt is manageable. “Made me think about work differently.” “Couldn’t put down.” “Beautiful world-building but slow.” App uses these patterns to suggest books: “You’ve loved 6 books you described as ‘couldn’t put down’—try this.” He builds useful reading memory without essay-writing.

**Design takeaway:** Emphasize “quick capture” language—this isn’t a book report, it’s memory insurance.

### User Story 3: Aisha, 29, Nonprofit Program Director

Aisha reads 4-5 books monthly, wants to read more diversely but algorithms trap her. Income ~$51K. Active in book club, follows book accounts. Her problem: she loves literary fiction but wants to try mystery, sci-fi, poetry—genres she hasn’t explored since college. Amazon sees she rated literary fiction highly and only shows her more literary fiction. Goodreads “because you liked X” just shows similar books. She’s stuck in a filter bubble. She’ll ask friends for recommendations outside her usual but forgets to follow through.

**How Bookmark helps:** App’s “Discovery Mode” intentionally shows books outside her usual genres but matching feeling/mood patterns from her literary fiction loves. “You loved books you described as ‘beautiful sentences’—try this sci-fi novel readers describe the same way.” Journal tracks her genre diversity over time, celebrates when she branches out. After 6 months, she’s read across 8 genres, found new favorites.

**Design takeaway:** Make “breaking the bubble” feel like exploration, not algorithm manipulation—emphasize reader agency and curiosity.

### User Story 4: James, 38, High School Teacher

James reads 2-3 books monthly, summer reading jumps to 8-10/month. Income ~$54K. Book club member, recommends books to students. His problem: students ask for recommendations and he blanks on details—“There was this great book about… I can’t remember the title.” He’s read incredible books but can’t recall them when it matters. His Goodreads has dates and star ratings, nothing about why a book would work for specific students. He wants to be the teacher who gives perfect recommendations but his memory fails him.

**How Bookmark helps:** Journal’s “Would recommend to:” prompt makes him think about audience while the book is fresh. “Students interested in social justice.” “Readers who loved The Hate U Give.” App makes these notes searchable. Student asks for something like THUG, he searches that phrase, finds 4 books with that tag. He becomes the teacher who remembers, because the system remembers for him.

**Design takeaway:** Search/filter functionality needs to be powerful but simple—readers should find past books instantly by feeling, audience, or comparison.

Should one side be app setup, reverse side be journal setup? Format: fold-out card, multi-panel, bookmark-style? Consider: QR codes for app download, visual quick-start.

**Option 5: Direct Mail Campaign Piece**
Targets lapsed readers who’ve tried Goodreads and quit. What mailing format breaks through (postcard, folded self-mailer, envelope)? Should “Can’t remember the last great book you read?” be the hook? How feature journal + app integration in limited space? Call-to-action: buy journal, download app, visit website? Consider: personalization opportunity, dimensional mail.

**Option 6: Print Ad Series (Minimum 3 Ads)**
Where would these run? (Literary magazines, book review publications, New Yorker, airport magazine?) Sequential campaign or standalone messages? What hooks stop page-flippers—“Remember the feeling, not just the title”? How show physical + digital without looking complicated? Consider: One product per ad vs. integrated, testimonial-style vs. aspirational.

**Option 7: Bookstore Poster Series (3-5 Posters)**
Independent bookstore partnership—posters for stores that carry Bookmark. Informational (how it works) or emotional (why it matters)? How much copy vs. pure visual? Feature-specific posters (“Track Trusted Sources” / “Discover Outside the Algorithm” / “Remember What You’ve Read”) or integrated message? Consider: frameable art quality, bookstore aesthetic alignment.

### Digital Deliverable Options (Choose 2, or 1 if Designing Physical Product)

**Physical Product Design: The Reading Journal (Counts as 1 Digital Deliverable)**
Design the actual journal as digital mockup. Dimensions (6”x8” suggested, but explore), cover material/finish, interior page layouts (Want to Read / Currently Reading / Completed sections), ribbon bookmark color, binding type. How does cover communicate “sophisticated tool for serious readers”? What interior typography makes quick-capture feel easy? Consider: Lay-flat binding requirement, cover debossing/foiling, paper quality signaling.

Platform focus—Instagram/Threads for book community? Campaign concept: “Remember When” (books that stayed with you)? “Recommendation Receipts” (showing which sources actually deliver)? Goal: awareness, app downloads, journal sales? How create shareable content that doesn’t feel like ads? Feature-specific posts or emotional benefits? Consider: User-generated content opportunity, book club partnerships, author collaborations.

**Option 3: Website Landing Page**
Who’s landing here—curious readers, Goodreads refugees, gift buyers? What see immediately—founder story, product demo, problem/solution? How prominently feature “physical + digital” integration? Conversion goal: buy journal, download app, email signup? Mobile-first or desktop-first? Consider: App store download buttons prominence, journal purchase path clarity, “How it works” video space.

**Option 4: Email Campaign Series (Minimum 3 Emails)**
Purpose: Onboarding new users (welcome + setup guidance + first week tips)? Re-engagement for dormant users? Feature education drip? How make helpful not preachy—“Here’s how to…” vs “You should…”? Mobile-first design essential. Create emails readers want vs. delete immediately. Consider: Plain-text simplicity vs. designed template, personalization based on reading frequency.

**Option 5: Digital Advertising Campaign (Minimum 6 Ad Variations)**
Where run—Facebook/Instagram, podcast pre-roll display, book blog sidebar, Goodreads? Hook that stops scroll: “Still can’t remember if you liked that author’s other book?” Feature-specific ads (source tracking, discovery mode, memory prompts) or integrated message? Segment variations for different reader types? Consider: Video vs. static, testimonial vs. product-focused, retargeting vs. cold audience.

**Option 6: App Store Presence (Complete Listing)**
iOS App Store and/or Google Play. What makes download vs. scroll past? Screenshots showcase: dashboard, recommendation with reasoning, TBR management, source analysis, reading stats, journal integration. Which feature first—most impressive or most essential? App icon design, description copy (first 2 lines critical), feature bullets, ratings/reviews strategy. Consider: “Track Reading” is boring category, how differentiate, seasonal screenshots (summer reading, new year goals).

**Option 7: Animated Explainer Video Concept (Storyboard + Key Frames)**
Length (60 seconds recommended for social, 90-120 for website)? Animation style—hand-drawn warmth, clean motion graphics, hybrid live-action + animation? Narrative: problem/solution, day-in-life, founder story? How much time on features vs. emotional benefit? Consider: Voiceover tone (warm friend vs. sophisticated guide), music mood, ending CTA (download app, buy journal, learn more).

Think holistically about integrated campaign across channels. Consider: Influencer partnerships, book club pilot program, author collaborations.

### Research Guidance

**Audience Research:**
Search: r/books, r/52weeksofbooks, r/suggestmeabook subreddits | #BookTok, #Bookstagram hashtags (watch what readers complain about) | Book podcast communities (What Should I Read Next, Currently Reading) | Goodreads reviews (look for frustration patterns).

Find: Language readers use about recommendations | What they say about Goodreads/Amazon (complaints about algorithms, review culture) | How they currently track TBR lists | What makes them trust a recommendation | Phrases about forgetting books they’ve read.

**Competitive Research:**
Research: Book recommendation apps (Goodreads, StoryGraph, Literal) | Reading tracker apps | Book journaling communities | Subscription book boxes | Library apps.

Analyze: Visual territory (lots of cozy/cute—how differentiate for sophisticated readers?) | Messaging approaches (feature-focused vs. benefit-focused) | What features do they emphasize? | Where do users complain in reviews? | Who does “physical + digital” integration well (in any category)?

**Visual Research:**
Look: Dribbble/Behance (search: reading app, book journal, recommendation engine) | Premium stationery brands (Moleskine, Leuchtturm1917, Baron Fig) | Literary magazine design | Independent bookstore branding | Book cover design trends.

Collect: Color palettes that feel literary not childish | Typography that’s readable for long-form but distinctive | Journal layout systems (grid, prompts, white space) | Physical product photography (materials, textures, flat-lays).

**Market Research:**
Find statistics: How many books does average reader complete yearly | Reading app market size | Goodreads user satisfaction rates | E-book vs. physical book trends | Independent bookstore growth | Book podcast listener demographics.

Look: Pew Research Center (reading statistics) | Publishing industry reports | App Annie/Sensor Tower (book app downloads/revenue) | BookScan data (if accessible) | Surveys about reading habits post-pandemic.

### Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need from them:**

- Recommendation algorithm technical specs (how does it learn from journal entries?)
- App data structure (how are books, sources, moods, feelings stored/tagged?)
- Journal-to-app sync workflow (photo capture process, OCR capabilities?)
- Source tracking implementation (how does app analyze recommender success rates?)
- Discovery mode parameters (how does algorithm suggest outside filter bubble?)

**What they need from you:**

- Brand assets (logo files, color codes, typography specifications for app UI)
- UI design specifications (screen layouts, component library, interaction patterns)
- Iconography (for moods, genres, sources, features—consistent visual system)
- Copywriting (microcopy for prompts, error messages, empty states, onboarding)
- User flow priorities (which features are primary vs. secondary in navigation?)

**How to work together:**
Regular check-ins on technical constraints that affect design. Ask questions early about feasibility (Can journal sync work with handwriting? How accurate is mood pattern recognition?). Share work-in-progress for feedback. Be open to technical limitations requiring design adaptation. Explain design rationale (why sophisticated not cozy, why source tracking matters visually). They’re building the engine, you’re designing the experience—both essential.

### Final Reminders

This is not fill-in-the-blank work—creativity happens in how you interpret “sophisticated guide for readers.” Book recommendation apps often look cozy-cute or corporate-sterile. Bookmark should feel like a tool for discerning readers who take their reading life seriously. Your unique value proposition is **capturing context and feeling so readers remember**, not just consuming content. Emphasize the physical + digital integration—this only works because handwriting improves memory and the app provides intelligence. Every design decision needs rationale. This is portfolio-worthy work that demonstrates you understand: brand positioning, designing for meaningful behavior change, physical + digital product ecosystems, and sophisticated design for intelligent audiences.

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this feel like a tool for serious readers or casual browsers?
- Am I showing how physical journal + app work together, not separately?
- Does “remember the feeling” come through in visual and verbal language?
- Would this make someone choose Bookmark over free Goodreads?
- Does the design respect readers’ intelligence and time?
