# Design Planning for Multipage Layouts

## Introduction

A multipage layout is an extended conversation with your audience. Unlike a poster or social graphic, you have pages to develop ideas, tell stories, and provide depth.

But more space doesn't mean fill every inch. The best multipage pieces earn attention page by page. Every page that doesn't add value is a page where you lose your reader.

**Minimum Requirement:** 8 pages

**Key Principle:** This is a *separate* item from your campaign presentation—it's a deliverable *for* the campaign, not about it.

## Part 1: Purpose and Format Decision

### What Is This Piece Trying to Accomplish?

Before choosing print vs. digital, format, or page count—clarify the goal.

**Core Questions:**
- What does this piece accomplish that simpler formats can't?
- What does the audience need to *understand* or *do* after engaging with it?
- What's the context of use? (Reference material? One-time read? Shared document?)

**From the Briefs—Decision Speed Principle:**
> "Stop scrolling. Start watching. 2 minutes not 30."
> "Can I understand this in 3 seconds while sleep-deprived?"

Even in multipage layouts, respect your audience's time. More pages ≠ more value.

**Document:**
> This multipage piece serves **[specific purpose]** in the campaign. After engaging with it, the audience should **[understand/do X]**. It will be used in **[context]**.

### Print vs. Digital Decision

This isn't about what you can produce—it's about what serves the audience and campaign.

| Factor | Favors Print | Favors Digital |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Reach** | Limited distribution is acceptable | Wide distribution needed |
| **Permanence** | Content is stable; physical presence valuable | Content may need updates |
| **Interaction** | Reading experience; tactile engagement | Links, video, forms, real-time data |
| **Cost** | Budget supports production | No production budget; or distribution at scale |
| **Context** | Physical handoff; retail/event environment | Remote audience; electronic sharing |
| **Audience Behavior** | Research shows preference for physical | Research shows digital engagement |

**Physical Presence Principle (from the briefs):**
> Physical presence matters. Tangible components create boundaries, accountability, and ambient awareness that purely digital tools lack.

Consider: Does this piece benefit from physical presence, or does digital delivery better serve the use case?

**Document Your Decision:**
> I'm creating a **[print/digital]** multipage piece because **[rationale based on purpose, audience, and context]**.

## Part 2: Format Specifications

### Print Formats

**Booklet Styles:**
- **Saddle-stitched (stapled):** 8-48 pages, economical, casual to professional
- **Perfect bound:** 48+ pages, spine visible, more "book-like"
- **Wire/spiral bound:** Lies flat, pages tear out, functional over polished

**Folded Formats:**
- **Gate fold:** Reveals content dramatically; used for presentations
- **Accordion/Z-fold:** Sequential reveal; unfolds to larger format
- **Roll fold:** Panels revealed in sequence; common for brochures

**Page Size Considerations:**

| Size | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 8.5" × 11" (Letter) | Versatile, economical | Familiar; may feel generic |
| 5.5" × 8.5" (Half-letter) | Portable, booklet feel | More intimate; less imposing |
| Square formats | Image-heavy, modern aesthetic | Stands out; unusual = memorable |
| Horizontal formats | Panoramic images, presentations | Landscape orientation |
| Custom sizes | Brand-specific aesthetic | Higher cost; differentiation |

**Production Technical Requirements:**

| Specification | Standard | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Bleed | 0.125" all sides | Extends design past trim |
| Safety margin | 0.25"+ from trim | Keep critical content inside |
| Resolution | 300 DPI | Lower = visible quality issues |
| Color mode | CMYK | Convert from RGB before final |
| Page count | Multiples of 4 (print) | Imposed sheets fold to 4 pages |

---

### Digital Formats

**Presentation Formats:**
- **Slide deck (16:9):** Standard presentation, screen-optimized
- **PDF document:** Universal access, print-ready if needed
- **Interactive flipbook:** Mimics print experience with digital features
- **Web-based (scrolling):** Native digital; SEO-friendly; linkable

**Digital-Specific Advantages:**
- Hyperlinks (internal and external)
- Embedded video/audio
- Animated elements
- Form integration
- Real-time updates after "publication"
- Analytics on engagement

**Platform Considerations:**

| Platform | Best For | Limitations |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| InDesign Publish Online | Professional layouts | Requires InDesign skills |
| PowerPoint/Slides | Presentations; familiarity | Limited design control |
| Canva | Quick production; templates | Can look template-derived |
| Issuu/FlipHTML | Flipbook experience | Platform-dependent hosting |
| PDF | Universal access | Static; no interactivity |

## Part 3: Content Strategy

### Every Page Earns Its Place

The brief is clear: "Every page must add value; avoid 'fluff' content."

**The Earn-It Test:**
For each planned page, answer:
- What does this page accomplish that couldn't be handled in less space?
- What would be lost if this page were removed?
- Does this page advance the piece's purpose?

If you can't answer these questions, the page shouldn't exist.

---

### Information Architecture

**From the Briefs:**
> BAD: Here's 47 data points → You figure it out
> GOOD: Here's what matters → Here's what to do about it

Even in detailed multipage pieces, lead with clarity. Don't bury the point.

**Content Hierarchy Principle:**

| Level | What It Does | How Much Space |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Essential** | Must understand to get value | Prominent, early |
| **Important** | Enriches understanding | Clear, accessible |
| **Supporting** | For those who want depth | Available but not dominant |
| **Reference** | For later lookup | Organized, findable |

Don't give equal weight to all content. Prioritize ruthlessly.

---

### Content Mapping

Plan content before designing pages.

**Map the sequence:**

| Page(s) | Content Purpose | Key Information | Visual Approach |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2-3 | | | |
| ... | | | |

**Opening Pages:**
- Establish context
- Create interest
- Set expectations for what follows

**Body Pages:**
- Deliver core content
- Build logically
- Maintain visual interest and pacing

**Closing Pages:**
- Summarize or synthesize
- Direct action (CTA)
- Provide next steps or reference

---

### Pacing and Rhythm

Readers fatigue. Vary your approach across pages.

**Pacing Techniques:**
- Alternate text-heavy and image-heavy spreads
- Use white space intentionally (rest for the eye)
- Create visual "beats"—moments of emphasis
- Change grid or layout approach for section transitions

**Spread Thinking:**
In print especially, facing pages are experienced together. Design spreads, not just pages.

---

## Part 4: Visual Consistency

### System Establishment

A multipage piece needs a system, not page-by-page invention.

**Elements to Define:**
- Grid structure (columns, margins, baseline)
- Typography hierarchy (heading levels, body, captions)
- Color usage (where do colors appear?)
- Image treatment (sizing, cropping, placement patterns)
- Recurring elements (page numbers, section indicators, headers/footers)

**Document Your System:**
> The grid is **[description]**. Typography uses **[fonts/sizes for each level]**. Color appears **[where/how]**. Images follow **[treatment pattern]**.

---

### Brand Alignment

This piece represents the brand established in earlier deliverables.

**Consistency Check:**
- Does typography match the brand system?
- Does color usage follow brand guidelines?
- Does imagery style align with the brand aesthetic?
- Does the overall feel match other campaign touchpoints?

**Voice Consistency:**
From the briefs—the same voice principles apply to multipage content:
- Supportive without toxic positivity
- Intelligent without pretentious
- Validating, not dismissive
- Clear and actionable, not data-dumping

---

## Part 5: Interactivity Planning (Digital)

If creating a digital format, plan interactive elements.

### Interactive Element Options

| Element | Purpose | Consideration |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Hyperlinks** | Navigation; external resources | Test all links; consider maintenance |
| **Embedded video** | Dynamic content; demonstration | File size; hosting requirements |
| **Animation** | Emphasis; interest | Subtlety > showiness; consider accessibility |
| **Forms** | Data collection; engagement | Integration requirements; privacy |
| **Navigation** | User control | Clear wayfinding; don't over-complicate |

### User Experience Planning

**Questions to Answer:**
- How does the user navigate? (Sequential? Jump to sections? Both?)
- What happens when they click things?
- Is the interface intuitive or does it require instruction?
- How does this work on mobile vs. desktop?

**Document Your Approach:**
> Navigation allows **[description]**. Interactive elements include **[list]** for purposes of **[rationale]**.

---

## Part 6: Product-Type Considerations

Different product categories may require different multipage approaches:

### For Health/Monitoring Products
- Content should feel reassuring, not clinical
- Validation language matters—acknowledge the user's experience
- "Everything normal" should feel good, not dismissive
- Avoid medical jargon that creates distance

### For Decision Support Products
- Structure content to enable faster decisions
- Don't present more options—present clearer guidance
- The piece should reduce decision fatigue, not add to it

### For Productivity/Task Products
- Scaffold executive function—break complex content into manageable pieces
- Progress over perfection mentality
- Don't lecture about trying harder

### For Family/Shared Products
- Reflect real families, not Pinterest perfection
- Acknowledge that chaos is normal
- Support collaboration, not competition

---

## Part 7: Distribution Planning

### How Does This Piece Reach the Audience?

**Print Distribution:**
- Physical handoff at event/location
- Direct mail
- In-store/retail placement
- Included with product

**Digital Distribution:**
- Direct link (email, social, website)
- Embedded on website
- QR code from physical touchpoints
- Download from landing page

**Document:**
> This piece will reach the audience via **[method(s)]**. This choice aligns with **[audience behavior from research]**.

---

### Access and Compatibility

**For Digital:**
- Does the format work on the devices your audience uses?
- Are there download requirements or can it be viewed in-browser?
- What happens if someone shares it?
- Can you track engagement?

**For Print:**
- What quantity is needed?
- What's the timeline for production?
- How are extras stored/managed?
