# Design Planning for Branding and Campaign

## Introduction

Before you design anything, you need to know *who* you're designing for—and you need to commit to that choice completely.

This isn't about filling out a demographic worksheet. It's about understanding someone well enough that your design decisions become obvious. When you truly understand your audience, you stop guessing about colors and fonts and start *knowing* what will resonate.

**The Core Principle:**
> Every design decision should be traceable back to an audience insight. If you can't explain *why* a choice serves your audience, you haven't finished thinking.

## Workflow Overview

| Stage | What You're Doing | What You're Producing |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **UNDERSTAND** | Deep audience research | Documented insights with sources |
| **EXPLORE** | Visual research & ideation | Moodboards, sketches, rationale |
| **MATERIALIZE** | Design execution | Deliverables that serve audience needs |

---

## Part 1: Target Audience Research

### The Critical Choice

Many products serve multiple audiences. Your brief may describe several user types. **You must choose ONE primary audience and design specifically for them.**

This isn't limiting—it's liberating. Trying to appeal to everyone produces generic design that resonates with no one. Committing to one audience lets you make bold, specific choices.

**Common Dual-Audience Patterns:**

| Pattern | Example | Design Implication |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| User + Gift-Giver | Students + Parents | Different messages, same product |
| Patient + Caregiver | Health user + Family member | Different information depth |
| Individual + Partner | Solo user + Couple deciding together | Shared decision-making interface |
| Professional + Client | Freelancer + Their customers | Different credibility needs |

#### Before You Proceed

Review your brief and identify:
- Who are the potential audiences described?
- What makes each audience distinct?
- Which audience is the PRIMARY user vs. secondary?

**Document your choice:**

> I am designing for **[specific audience]** because **[rationale from brief and research]**.
>
> Secondary audiences (like gift-givers, caregivers, or partners) will encounter this design, but every creative decision will be made for the primary user.

### 1. Understanding the Basics

Don't just list demographics—understand what they *mean* for design.

**Demographics to Document:**
- Age range and life stage
- Geographic context (urban/suburban/rural, region)
- Economic situation relevant to this product
- Educational or professional background

**The Design Question:**
> What does each demographic factor suggest about visual preferences, communication style, or product relationship?

*Example: "Ages 18-22, college students" doesn't just mean "young adults"—it means managing scattered platforms, limited budgets, and high cognitive load. That's a systems problem your design can acknowledge.*

---

### 2. Psychographic Research

This is where generic research becomes useful design fuel.

**Research and Document:**
- Values that drive purchasing decisions
- Interests and communities they identify with
- How they talk about problems like the one your product solves
- What builds or breaks trust for this audience

**Required Research Activity:**

Interview at least 2 people who match your target audience (classmates qualify). Ask:
- "How do you currently handle [problem your product solves]?"
- "What's frustrating about current solutions?"
- "Where do you discover new products like this?"
- "What would make you trust a brand in this space?"

Document findings with specific quotes when possible.

---

### 3. Behavioral Insights

**Research and Document:**
- When and where would they encounter this product?
- What's their current workaround for the problem?
- What are their buying patterns for similar products?
- How do they research before purchasing?

**The Design Question:**
> How does context of use affect format, size, messaging, and channel choices?

---

### 4. Emotional Landscape

**Identify and Document:**
- What frustrations does the audience experience around this problem?
- What aspirations or desires connect to your product's solution?
- What emotions should the brand evoke? (Be specific—not just "trust" but *what kind* of trust)

**Critical Framing by Product Type:**

The briefs reveal different emotional cores depending on product category:

| Product Type | Core Emotional Driver | Design Should Feel Like... |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Productivity/Task** | Overwhelm, executive function struggles | Supportive friend who gets it |
| **Financial** | Anxiety about control, fear of chaos | Reliable tool that always works |
| **Health/Monitoring** | Dismissed symptoms, validation need | Ally who believes you |
| **Decision Support** | Paralysis, too many options | Helper who speeds up decisions |
| **Family/Shared** | Mental load, coordination exhaustion | Partner in managing chaos |

**The Core Insight (from the briefs):**
> "You're not failing because of personal inadequacy. You're overwhelmed because the system wasn't designed for you. Good tools don't lecture about trying harder—they remove barriers that make good behavior hard."

---

### 5. Competitive Visual Research

**Required Research—No Handed Answers:**

Research at least 3 competitors or adjacent brands and document:
- What visual territory are they claiming? (colors, typography, imagery style)
- What language do they use in marketing?
- What do users complain about in reviews?
- Where are the gaps you could fill?

**Document Your Findings:**

| Competitor | Visual Territory | Language/Voice | User Complaints | Gap/Opportunity |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

## Part 2: Visual Research and Positioning

Based on your audience and competitive research, develop your visual direction.

### What to Avoid

The briefs are explicit about visual approaches that fail:

| Category | Avoid | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Corporate** | Blue gradients, sterile minimalism | Feels cold, generic, doesn't build trust |
| **"Fellow Kids"** | Trendy fonts, meme aesthetics | Feels condescending, won't age well |
| **Playful/Cute** | Childish illustrations, cutesy mascots | Undermines professional credibility |
| **Gendered** | All-pink pastels, "girly" aesthetic | Excludes half the audience |
| **Cluttered** | Too many features, information overload | Creates anxiety, defeats purpose |
| **Clinical Sterile** | Cold hospital aesthetic | Medical-grade but intimidating |
| **Pinterest Perfection** | Unrealistic organization imagery | Sets impossible standard |
| **Toxic Positivity** | "Crush your goals!" aggressive optimism | Dismisses real struggles |

**Product-Specific Avoids:**

- **Women's Health:** Avoid baby pink, "girl boss" empowerment tropes
- **Senior-Adjacent:** Avoid patronizing "easy" buttons, oversimplified design
- **Sleep/Wellness:** Avoid sleep-shaming, hustle culture imagery
- **Family Products:** Avoid perfect family stock photos, unrealistic diversity tokenism
- **Kitchen/Home:** Avoid sterile smart-home aesthetic; should feel like tool, not gadget

---

### Color Strategy

Don't pick colors you like. Pick colors that:
- Differentiate from competitors
- Resonate with your specific audience
- Support the emotional positioning

**Document Your Rationale:**
> I'm exploring **[color direction]** because **[audience insight]** and **[competitive differentiation]**.

Consider: Vibrant / Warm Neutrals / Cool Neutrals / Muted / High Contrast / Other

---

### Typography Strategy

Fonts aren't decorative—they communicate personality before anyone reads a word.

**For Headlines/Display:**
- What personality should the headline font project?
- How does this serve your audience's expectations?

**For Body Text:**
- Readability is non-negotiable
- How does the body font support extended reading?

**Document Your Rationale:**
> I'm exploring **[font direction]** for headlines because it communicates **[personality trait]** which resonates with **[audience insight]**.

---

### Imagery Direction

**Research Question:** What photography or illustration style resonates with your specific audience?

Consider:
- What contexts should imagery show? (real-world use, aspirational, problem-state)
- Photography vs. illustration vs. mixed approach
- What should imagery *feel* like?

**From the Briefs:**
- Show real people in real contexts (job sites, dorm rooms, kitchens)
- Show the problem before showing the solution
- Avoid stock photo aesthetics
- Show both product AND emotional transformation
- Consider diversity authentically, not tokenistically

**Document Your Direction:**
> Imagery should show **[context/style]** because **[audience insight]**.

---

## Part 3: Voice and Tone

### The Voice Spectrum

Every brief warns against two extremes:

```
Corporate ←————————————————————→ "Fellow Kids"
              ↑
      SWEET SPOT: Authentic peer who acknowledges real struggles
```

**Voice Principles:**
- **Authentic over performative:** Don't try too hard to seem relatable
- **Supportive without toxic positivity:** Acknowledge difficulty genuinely
- **Intelligent without pretentious:** Show expertise without gatekeeping
- **Validating over dismissive:** Especially for health/monitoring products

**Voice Examples:**

| NOT This | NOT This Either | THIS |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| "Optimize your productivity metrics" | "This app is totally fire, no cap" | "You're managing six platforms while working—that's a systems problem, not a you problem." |
| "Crush your goals!" | "If you fail, you'll never recover" | "This is hard. Here's how to make it manageable." |
| "We track your data" | "Big Brother is watching (LOL)" | "See exactly where your money goes" |

---

### Trust-Building vs. Surveillance

When products involve tracking, monitoring, or data capture, framing matters:

| Surveillance Framing (AVOID) | Empowerment Framing (USE) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| "We track your spending" | "See exactly where your money goes" |
| "Monitor your progress" | "Visible progress keeps you motivated" |
| "Captures your data" | "Automatic backup so nothing gets lost" |
| "Records your behavior" | "Remembers what you liked so you don't have to" |

---

## Part 4: Ideation Methods

Use these techniques to generate concepts—but always connect back to audience insights.

### Structured Ideation

**Word Association:** Start with problem words from your audience research. What visual concepts connect?

**Metaphor Development:** What analogy captures the brand's role in the user's life?
- Is it a tool? A guide? A safety net? A collaborator? An ally?
- How might that metaphor translate visually?

**Constraint-Based Brainstorming:** Given what competitors own, what's left? How does limitation spark creativity?

### Sketch Documentation

Capture at least 5-10 rough concepts. For each, note:
- What audience insight does this serve?
- How does this differentiate from competitors?
- What might not work about this direction?

---

## Part 5: Alignment Check

Before moving to execution, verify your direction.

### The Rationale Test

For each major design decision, complete:

> I chose **[element/direction]** because **[audience insight or competitive reasoning]**.

If you can't complete this sentence, you're guessing. Go back to research.

### Product Category Questions

**For Productivity/Task Products:**
- Does this scaffold executive function rather than lecture about trying harder?
- Does progress over perfection feel genuine?
- Does the voice feel like a supportive peer, not a disappointed parent?

**For Health/Monitoring Products:**
- Does this validate user experiences rather than question them?
- Is medical credibility balanced with emotional warmth?
- Does "everything is normal" feel reassuring, not dismissive?

**For Decision Support Products:**
- Does this enable quick decisions, not just more options?
- Is the decision speed measurable and communicated?
- Does it break routine loops rather than reinforce them?

**For Financial Products:**
- Does tracking feel empowering, not surveillant?
- Does the tool feel like "favorite tool" quality?
- Is premium pricing justified by reliability?

### General Alignment Questions

- Does this design acknowledge the real difficulty your audience faces?
- Does it offer practical help rather than empty optimism?
- Does it respect the audience's intelligence?
- Would your interviewed users feel seen by this approach?
- Does it differentiate from what competitors are doing?

## Research Prompts for AI Tools

Use AI to accelerate research—not to replace your thinking.

**For Competitive Analysis:**
- "What visual design patterns are common in [your product category] marketing?"
- "What do users commonly complain about regarding [competitor] based on reviews?"

**For Audience Understanding:**
- "What challenges do [your specific audience] commonly face regarding [problem domain]?"
- "What communication styles resonate with [demographic] when discussing [topic]?"

**For Ideation Expansion:**
- "Given an audience that values [trait from research], what visual metaphors might communicate [brand attribute]?"
- "How might [specific design element] be perceived differently by [audience A] versus [audience B]?"

**Important:** AI responses are starting points for your own research and thinking—not final answers. Verify claims, test assumptions, and document your own conclusions.

## Deliverable: Audience & Direction Summary

Before proceeding to specific deliverables, document:

1. **Primary Audience Statement** (with rationale for choice)
2. **Key Insights** (from interviews and research, with sources)
3. **Competitive Landscape** (what's claimed, what's available)
4. **Visual Direction** (color, typography, imagery—each with rationale)
5. **Voice and Tone** (how should copy/messaging feel?)
6. **Differentiation Strategy** (what makes this approach distinct?)

This summary becomes your reference document for all subsequent design decisions. Every deliverable should trace back to insights documented here.
