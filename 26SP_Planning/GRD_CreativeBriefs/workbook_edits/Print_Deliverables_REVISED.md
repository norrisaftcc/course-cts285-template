# Design Planning for Print Deliverables

## Introduction

Print materials support a product launch beyond packaging—they're what customers encounter in stores, receive with their purchase, use as reference, and keep in their spaces. This module covers the range of print materials that promote and support your product and brand.

Your job is to identify which materials make sense for *your specific product and audience*, then plan them strategically.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Print Categories

Print deliverables for product launches generally fall into these categories:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Retail/POS** | Captures attention at point of sale | Displays, shelf talkers, aisle signage, counter cards |
| **Instructional** | Helps users understand and use the product | Quick start guides, instruction sheets, reference cards |
| **Promotional** | Builds awareness and interest | Posters, flyers, postcards, banners |
| **Utility Items** | Provides ongoing value while reinforcing brand | Magnets, bookmarks, journals, planners, tracking cards |

*Note: Product packaging is covered in its own dedicated module.*

---

### Product-Specific Considerations

Different products need different print support. Consider:

**Physical Tech Products** (devices, accessories):
- Retail displays compete for shelf attention
- Quick start guides reduce support burden
- Reference cards support ongoing use

**Subscription Services** (apps, platforms):
- POS materials may promote trial/signup
- Reference cards/magnets provide persistent reminders
- Instructional materials support onboarding

**Physical + Digital Products** (devices with apps):
- Retail presence drives discovery
- Setup guides bridge physical and digital
- Utility items (planners, trackers) extend the brand into daily life

**Health/Monitoring Products:**
- Reference cards should feel reassuring, not clinical
- Quick guides should reduce anxiety, not add to it
- Tracking materials should empower, not surveil

**Decision Support Products:**
- Reference materials should enable quick decisions
- Utility items should reduce friction, not add steps

---

## Part 2: Retail and Point-of-Sale Materials

If your product will be sold in physical retail environments, POS materials help it compete for attention.

### Types of Retail/POS Materials

| Type | Placement | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Counter Display** | Checkout area, service counter | Impulse purchase, small product showcase |
| **Floor Display/Standee** | Aisle end, open floor space | Major presence, multiple product showcase |
| **Shelf Talker** | Attached to shelf edge | Calls out product among competitors |
| **Aisle Blade** | Perpendicular to aisle | Visibility from aisle traffic |
| **Hanging Sign** | Suspended from ceiling/fixture | Department/category wayfinding |
| **Window Cling/Poster** | Store windows, walls | Awareness, promotion |
| **End Cap Display** | End of aisle | Prime promotional real estate |
| **Dump Bin** | Floor placement | High-volume, value positioning |

---

### POS Design Considerations

**Visibility and Distance:**
- How far away will viewers be when they first see this?
- What must be readable at that distance?
- What's competing for attention in the same sightline?

**Structural Requirements:**
- How will it stand, mount, or attach?
- What weight must it support (if displaying product)?
- How long must it last in the retail environment?
- Does it need to ship flat and assemble on-site?

**Retail Environment:**
- What store type is this? (Big box? Boutique? Grocery? Electronics?)
- What fixtures and display standards exist?
- What are typical dimensions/footprints allowed?
- What do competitors' displays look like in this space?

---

### POS Research Requirements

**Don't design retail materials without visiting actual retail environments.**

Research Tasks:
- Visit stores where this product would be sold
- Photograph existing POS materials and displays
- Note sizes, placements, and mounting methods
- Observe what catches attention vs. gets ignored
- Document competitor presence and approach

**Document Your Observations:**
> In **[store type]**, I observed POS materials including **[specific examples]**. Standard placements/sizes include **[observations]**. Competitor presence: **[what they're doing]**. Opportunities for differentiation: **[specific gaps or ideas]**.

---

### If Selecting POS Deliverables

**Document for Each:**

> **Type:** [e.g., Shelf Talker]
>
> **Intended Retail Context:** [specific store type and placement]
>
> **Dimensions/Format:** [based on retail standards observed]
>
> **Structural Approach:** [how it stands/mounts/attaches]
>
> **Key Message:** [what must communicate in 2-3 seconds]
>
> **Selection Rationale:** I'm including this because **[specific retail strategy reason tied to research]**.

---

## Part 3: Instructional and Reference Materials

Good instructional materials reduce friction and support the user experience.

### Types of Instructional Materials

| Type | Purpose | Format Considerations |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Quick Start Guide** | Get user to first success fast | Folded card or small booklet; minimal text, visual steps |
| **Instruction Manual** | Complete reference | Booklet format; balance thoroughness with usability |
| **Setup Card** | Single-task guidance | One sheet; step-by-step with clear visuals |
| **Reference Card** | Ongoing quick reference | Durable material; designed to be kept and reused |
| **Comparison Card** | Decision support (features, models) | At-a-glance format; clear visual hierarchy |
| **Size/Fit Guide** | Selection help | Visual, dimensional, often kept for future reference |
| **Troubleshooting Card** | Self-service support | Problem → solution format; reduces support calls |

---

### Instructional Design Principles

**From the Briefs—Key Insight:**
> "Can I understand this in 3 seconds while sleep-deprived?" beats "Look how much it can do!"

**Prioritize:**
- **First success:** What's the minimum to get the user started?
- **Visual guidance:** Show, don't just tell
- **Scannability:** Numbers, headers, clear hierarchy
- **Durability:** If it's a reference, will it survive repeated use?

**Avoid:**
- Dense text blocks
- Jargon or assumed knowledge
- Burying critical steps in paragraphs
- Too many steps on one card/page

---

### Product-Type Considerations for Instructions

**For Health/Monitoring Products:**
- Instructions should feel reassuring, not clinical or intimidating
- "Everything is working correctly" should be the default message
- Avoid anxiety-inducing language or unnecessary warnings
- Reference cards should empower self-management

**For Decision Support Products:**
- Quick-reference materials should enable faster decisions
- "2 minutes, not 30" principle applies to instructions too
- Don't create reference material that adds steps

**For Physical + Digital Products:**
- Bridge the physical-digital gap clearly
- First physical interaction should point to digital setup smoothly
- Reference cards should work without needing the app open

---

### Instructional Content Strategy

**Map content to user moments:**

| User Moment | Content Needed | Best Format |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| First opening | "What do I do first?" | Quick start card |
| Initial setup | Step-by-step guidance | Setup guide |
| Regular use | How to do specific tasks | Reference card |
| Problem encountered | "Why isn't this working?" | Troubleshooting guide |
| Ongoing reference | Specifications, compatibility | Durable reference card |

---

### If Selecting Instructional Materials

**Document for Each:**

> **Type:** [e.g., Quick Start Guide]
>
> **Format:** [dimensions, fold style, page count, material]
>
> **Content Scope:** [specifically what this piece covers—not everything]
>
> **User Moment:** [when/where will user encounter this?]
>
> **Selection Rationale:** I'm including this because **[specific user need identified]**.

---

## Part 4: Promotional Print Materials

Promotional materials build awareness and drive action. Select strategically based on distribution context.

### Types of Promotional Materials

| Type | Best For | Considerations |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Posters** | Public spaces, events, retail walls | Size for viewing distance; single clear message |
| **Flyers** | Events, handouts, inserts | Brief attention; immediate takeaway |
| **Postcards** | Direct mail, leave-behinds, events | Two-sided opportunity; mailable if needed |
| **Banners** | Events, storefronts, trade shows | Scale, portability, reusability |
| **Brochures** | Detailed information takeaway | Fold mechanics; information architecture |
| **Table Tents** | Restaurants, events, waiting areas | Small footprint; eye-level while seated |
| **Door Hangers** | Localized/neighborhood marketing | Targeted distribution; immediate visibility |

---

### Promotional Material Strategy

**Ask Before Selecting:**
- Where exactly would this be distributed or displayed?
- What action should it drive? (Visit site? Try product? Learn more?)
- What's the attention context? (Passing by? Waiting? Actively seeking?)
- What happens after first contact? (Kept? Discarded? Passed along?)
- Who's responsible for distribution?

**Voice Considerations:**

From the briefs, promotional voice should be:
- **Supportive without toxic positivity:** "This is hard. Here's how to make it manageable." NOT "Crush your goals!"
- **Empowering without surveillance framing:** "See where your money goes" NOT "We track your spending"
- **Validating without dismissing:** Especially for health products—acknowledge the struggle is real

**Avoid:**
- Selecting formats just because they're familiar
- Creating materials with no clear distribution plan
- Generic messaging that could apply to any product

---

### If Selecting Promotional Materials

**Document for Each:**

> **Type:** [e.g., Event Poster]
>
> **Distribution Context:** [specifically where and how]
>
> **Dimensions/Format:** [size, orientation, material]
>
> **Key Message:** [single primary takeaway]
>
> **Call to Action:** [what should viewer do next?]
>
> **Selection Rationale:** I'm including this because **[connection to specific audience behavior or distribution opportunity]**.

---

## Part 5: Utility Print Items

Utility items provide ongoing value while maintaining brand presence in the user's space.

### Types of Utility Items

| Type | Ongoing Value | Brand Benefit |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Magnets** | Schedules, reminders, reference, decor | Persistent kitchen/office presence |
| **Bookmarks** | Reading utility | Repeated exposure during reading |
| **Planners/Journals** | Organization, tracking, reflection | Extended daily engagement |
| **Tracking Cards** | Logging, monitoring, collecting | Functional touchpoint tied to product use |
| **Calendars** | Date reference | Year-long visibility |
| **Stickers** | Personalization, identification | User-chosen brand display |
| **Coasters** | Surface protection | Repeated exposure during use |

---

### Utility Item Strategy

**From the Briefs:**
> Physical presence matters. Tangible components create boundaries, accountability, and ambient awareness that purely digital tools lack.

**Key Principle:**
> Physical presence where the decision/action happens; digital for processing/tracking/remote access.

**Key Questions:**
- What would the user actually use and keep long-term?
- How does the utility connect to the product's purpose?
- What's the balance of brand presence vs. pure function?
- What quality level makes this a "keeper" not a "tosser"?

---

### Utility Items by Product Type

**From the Briefs—Physical Tie-In Examples:**

| Product Type | Utility Item Examples | Why It Works |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Financial tracking | Expense log cards, receipt organizers | Physical backup when digital fails |
| Task management | Planning magnets, deadline trackers | Ambient awareness—can't dismiss like notification |
| Recipe/food | Inventory magnets, meal planning cards | Present in kitchen where decisions happen |
| Health monitoring | Symptom trackers, medication cards | Documentation for provider conversations |
| Reading/media | Bookmarks, reading logs | "Remember why you saved it" context |

**Connection to Product:**
The best utility items extend the product experience, not just slap a logo on something generic. The utility should connect to the problem the product solves.

---

### Guilt Reduction Principle

From the briefs, many products address guilt cycles:
- Food waste guilt → Use-what-you-have visibility
- Forgotten task guilt → Ambient reminders
- Money waste guilt → Spending visibility
- Health neglect guilt → Easy tracking

**Utility items should prevent guilt-causing behavior, not just document it.**

---

### If Selecting Utility Items

**Document for Each:**

> **Item:** [e.g., Weekly Meal Planning Magnet]
>
> **Utility Provided:** [what ongoing value does this deliver?]
>
> **Usage Context:** [where will it live? how will it be used?]
>
> **Product Connection:** [how does this extend or support the product experience?]
>
> **Brand Integration:** [how does brand appear without overwhelming utility?]
>
> **Selection Rationale:** I'm including this because **[connection to product purpose and documented audience need]**.

---

## Part 6: Technical Specifications

### Print Production Basics

All print materials share certain technical requirements:

| Specification | Standard | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Resolution** | 300 DPI minimum | Lower = visible quality loss in print |
| **Color Mode** | CMYK | RGB won't reproduce accurately |
| **Bleed** | 0.125" (1/8") typical | Extends design past trim edge |
| **Safety Margin** | 0.25" minimum | Keep critical content inside this zone |
| **File Format** | PDF/X-1a or print-ready PDF | Confirm with specific vendor |

---

### Format-Specific Considerations

**Folded Pieces (brochures, guides):**
- Account for panel widths (inner panels often slightly narrower)
- Design for fold sequence (what's seen first, second, third?)
- Paper weight affects fold quality
- Score vs. fold depends on paper thickness

**Large Format (posters, banners):**
- Resolution can be lower for distance viewing (150 DPI often acceptable)
- Viewing distance determines minimum text size
- Material affects durability and display method
- Consider how it ships and installs

**Die-Cut Pieces (custom shapes):**
- Custom dies add cost
- Minimum detail size depends on cutting method
- Structural integrity at thin points

**Durable Items (magnets, reference cards):**
- Material thickness affects perceived quality
- Coating/lamination extends life
- Consider use context (wet environments, handling frequency)

---

## Part 7: Selection and Documentation

### Selection Summary

Based on your product, audience, and launch context, select print deliverables from across categories.

**Minimum Requirement:** Select from at least **two different categories.**

---

### Documentation Template

For each selected deliverable:

**Deliverable:** [Specific item]

**Category:** [ ] Retail/POS | [ ] Instructional | [ ] Promotional | [ ] Utility

**Format Specifications:**
- Dimensions:
- Paper/Material:
- Fold/Construction:
- Finish (coating, lamination, etc.):

**Distribution/Placement:**
> This piece will be **[distributed how / placed where]**.

**Purpose:**
> This piece serves **[specific function]** for **[specific audience]** at **[specific moment in their journey]**.

**Selection Rationale:**
> I chose this deliverable because **[connection to research, audience need, and product context]**.
>
> I chose this format/size because **[specific reasoning]**.

---

## Part 8: Vendor and Production Research

### Before Finalizing Designs

Research production options for your deliverables:

- What vendors produce these formats?
- What are standard sizes vs. custom costs?
- What are minimum quantities and price breaks?
- What's the production timeline?
- What file specifications are required?
- What proofing options exist (digital proof, physical sample)?

**Document Key Findings:**
> For **[deliverable]**, production options include **[vendors researched]**. Standard dimensions are **[specs]**. At estimated quantity of **[number]**, approximate cost is **[range]**.

---

## Research Prompts for AI Tools

**For Category Research:**
- "What print materials typically support a [product type] launch?"
- "What POS materials are effective in [retail environment type]?"

**For Format Research:**
- "What are standard dimensions for [specific deliverable type]?"
- "What paper stocks are appropriate for [use case]?"

**For Competitive Research:**
- "What print materials do [competitors in category] use?"
- "What instructional approaches work for [product type]?"

**Remember:** AI provides starting points. Visit actual retail locations to see real examples. Get actual vendor quotes. Base format decisions on observed standards, not assumptions.
