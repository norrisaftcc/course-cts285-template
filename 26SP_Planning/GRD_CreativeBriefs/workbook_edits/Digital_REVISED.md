# Design Planning for Digital Deliverables

## Introduction

Digital deliverables aren't an afterthought to "also make a social media version." They're often the first—or only—touchpoint your audience has with the brand.

Before selecting formats and sizes, understand *where your specific audience actually spends time* and *how they engage with content* in those spaces. The right deliverable in the wrong context is wasted effort.

---

## Part 1: Platform Research

### Don't Assume—Investigate

**Critical Guidance from the Briefs:**
> "Which social platform is most strategic—don't assume Instagram because you use it."

Your audience may or may not be where you expect. Research before selecting platforms.

**Required Research:**

For your specific target audience, investigate:
- Where do they discover new products/brands in this category?
- What platforms do they actively engage with vs. passively scroll?
- How do they research before purchasing?
- What content formats get their attention?

**Research Methods:**
- Interview your target audience (classmates who match the demographic qualify)
- Observe actual behavior (where are people discussing this problem space?)
- Review competitor presence (where are they investing, and does it seem to work?)

**Document Your Findings:**

| Platform | Audience Presence | Engagement Type | Competitors Active? | Strategic Fit |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

### Platform Selection Rationale

Based on research, select 2-3 primary platforms for your digital strategy.

**Document for Each:**
> I'm prioritizing **[platform]** because **[audience research finding]**. This platform serves **[specific goal]**.

---

## Part 2: Deliverable Types and Considerations

### Webpage Elements

Digital presence often requires web-based components, even if the product is physical.

**Potential Web Deliverables:**
- Landing page (entry point for awareness)
- Product page (detailed information and conversion)
- About/brand story page
- Blog or content templates

**Key Considerations:**

| Element | Research Question | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Responsiveness** | How does your audience primarily access websites? | Mobile-first vs. desktop depends on actual behavior |
| **Page Goals** | What single action should users take? | Clarity prevents confusion |
| **Load Context** | How patient is your audience? | Visual complexity has speed costs |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | What must be seen in 3 seconds? | Scanning behavior is universal |

**Decision Speed Principle (from the briefs):**
> "Can I understand this in 3 seconds while sleep-deprived?" beats "Look how much it can do!"

For decision-support products especially, the interface should enable quick decisions—not present more data to analyze.

**If Selecting Web Deliverables, Document:**
> The webpage serves **[specific purpose]** with primary CTA of **[action]**. Key information that must be immediately visible: **[list]**. This supports the audience's typical behavior of **[research finding]**.

---

### Email Campaigns

Direct communication that lands in personal inboxes.

**Potential Email Deliverables:**
- Welcome/onboarding sequence
- Promotional announcements
- Newsletter template
- Event invitations
- Transactional email templates

**Key Considerations:**

| Element | Question to Answer |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Subject Line Zone** | What's visible before opening? (Preview text strategy) |
| **Above the Fold** | What must the reader see without scrolling? |
| **Single CTA** | What one action are you asking for? |
| **Mobile Rendering** | How does this look on phone screens? |
| **Brand Consistency** | Does this feel like the same brand as other touchpoints? |

**Voice Considerations:**
Email is personal space. The briefs' guidance on voice applies strongly here:
- Supportive without toxic positivity
- Helpful without surveillance framing
- Clear without overwhelming

**If Selecting Email Deliverables, Document:**
> This email type serves **[purpose in customer journey]**. Primary CTA: **[single action]**. The email should feel **[emotional quality]** because **[audience insight]**.

---

### Social Media Graphics

Visual identity within platform ecosystems.

**Profile/Identity Elements:**
- Profile pictures (often circular crop, very small display)
- Cover/header images (platform-specific dimensions)
- Story highlights covers
- Pinned post graphics

**Content Graphics:**
- Static post images
- Carousel sequences
- Story frames
- Video thumbnails

**Key Considerations:**

| Element | Question to Answer |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Platform Specs** | What are exact dimensions and safe zones? |
| **Context** | What surrounds this content in the feed? |
| **Recognition** | Can users identify the brand at thumbnail size? |
| **Consistency** | Is there a system, or just individual posts? |

**If Selecting Social Deliverables, Document:**
> For **[platform]**, I'm creating **[specific deliverable types]** because **[how audience uses this platform from research]**. Brand recognition will be maintained through **[consistent elements]**.

---

### App/Interface Graphics

If your product includes a digital interface, design elements may be needed.

**Potential Interface Deliverables:**
- App icon
- Onboarding screens
- Empty states
- Notification graphics
- Feature illustrations

**Product-Type Considerations:**

| Product Type | Interface Priority | Key Principle |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Productivity** | Clarity, calm, progress visibility | "Reduces anxiety, not adds to it" |
| **Health/Monitoring** | Reassurance, validation, appropriate alerts | "Everything normal" as default state |
| **Decision Support** | Speed, confidence, clear recommendations | "2 minutes, not 30" |
| **Financial** | Visibility, control, trust signals | "Empowering, not surveillant" |

**Passive Monitoring Principle (for health/tracking products):**
> The best monitoring is invisible until it matters. Default state should communicate "everything is normal" to reduce anxiety, not create it.

---

### Video-Adjacent Graphics

Even without video production, video platforms require graphic design.

**Potential Deliverables:**
- Custom thumbnails (often the entire discovery experience)
- Channel art/banners
- End screens with CTAs
- Lower thirds/title cards

**Key Considerations:**

| Element | Question to Answer |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Thumbnail Competition** | What do competing thumbnails look like? How will yours stand out? |
| **Click Decision** | What information helps someone decide to click? |
| **Title Overlap** | Where does YouTube/platform place text over your thumbnail? |
| **Brand System** | Is there a recognizable series look? |

**If Selecting Video Graphics, Document:**
> Video graphics for **[platform]** serve **[purpose]**. Key differentiation from competitor thumbnails: **[observation from research]**. Consistent brand recognition maintained through **[system]**.

---

## Part 3: Information Architecture

### The Speed Principle

Multiple briefs emphasize decision speed:
- "Stop scrolling. Start watching. 2 minutes not 30." (StreamPix)
- "Decide 'what's for dinner?' in under 2 minutes" (Pantry)
- "Can I understand this in 3 seconds while sleep-deprived?" (StudyStream)

**Design Implication:**
Digital deliverables should enable quick comprehension and action—not present more information to process.

```
BAD:  Here's 47 data points → You figure it out
GOOD: Here's what matters → Here's what to do about it
```

### Content Hierarchy

For each digital deliverable, define:

1. **3-Second Level:** What must be understood immediately?
2. **10-Second Level:** What's the next layer of information?
3. **Deep Dive:** What's available for those who want more?

Most users never reach level 3. Design for levels 1 and 2.

---

## Part 4: Technical Requirements

### Platform-Specific Specifications

**Do Not Guess.** Look up current specifications for each platform you're targeting.

Platforms update dimensions and requirements regularly. Research current specs before designing.

**Document for Each Deliverable:**

| Deliverable | Platform | Dimensions | File Format | Size Limit | Safe Zone Notes |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| | | | | | |

---

### Responsive Considerations

Digital deliverables may appear on screens from watches to 4K monitors.

**Questions to Answer:**
- What's the minimum size this will render?
- What's the maximum size this will render?
- How does the design adapt between extremes?
- Are there critical elements that must remain visible at all sizes?

---

### Performance and Accessibility

**Load Time:**
- File sizes affect load time
- Load time affects engagement and SEO
- Compression and format choices matter

**Accessibility:**
- Color contrast must meet WCAG standards
- Don't convey meaning through color alone
- Alt text/descriptions for screen readers
- Readable typography at intended sizes

---

## Part 5: Deliverable Selection

Based on your platform research and goals, select specific digital deliverables.

### Selection Criteria

For each potential deliverable, evaluate:

- [ ] Does this align with where my audience actually engages? (Research-backed)
- [ ] Does this support specific objectives?
- [ ] Do I have rationale for why this format over alternatives?
- [ ] Can I execute this at quality level appropriate to the brand positioning?

### Documentation Template

For each selected deliverable:

**Deliverable:** [Specific type]

**Platform(s):** [Where it will appear]

**Dimensions/Specs:** [Exact specifications]

**Purpose:** [What it accomplishes]

**Selection Rationale:** I chose this deliverable because [audience research finding] and [goal connection].

**Technical Requirements:**
- Format: 
- Maximum file size:
- Color mode:
- Special considerations:

---

## Part 6: System Thinking

Individual deliverables are part of a larger system. Plan for consistency and efficiency.

### Visual Consistency

**Questions to Answer:**
- What elements remain constant across all digital deliverables?
- What elements adapt per platform while maintaining brand recognition?
- How does someone know this is the same brand across touchpoints?

**Document Your System:**
> Consistent elements across platforms include **[list]**. Platform-specific adaptations include **[list with rationale]**.

---

### Template and Component Thinking

Design for repeatability, not one-offs.

- What components will be reused across multiple posts/pages?
- What's the system for creating new content within the brand framework?
- How will future content maintain consistency without designer intervention?

---

## Research Prompts for AI Tools

**For Platform Research:**
- "What are current best practices for [platform] content in [your industry/category]?"
- "What engagement patterns are common for [audience demographic] on [platform]?"

**For Technical Specifications:**
- "What are current image specifications for [platform] [specific placement]?"
- "What file formats and compression settings optimize for [platform] performance?"

**For Competitive Analysis:**
- "How do [competitors in your space] use [platform]? What patterns emerge?"
- "What visual approaches are overused in [category] social content?"

**Remember:** AI provides starting points for research. Verify current specifications directly from platform documentation. Observe actual competitor content yourself. Draw your own conclusions from audience research.
