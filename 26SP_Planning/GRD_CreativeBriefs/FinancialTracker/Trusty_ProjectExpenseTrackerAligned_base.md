# PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

## Project Overview

Create a complete brand identity and product system for **Trusty**—a project-based expense tracking platform that serves TWO distinct markets through a single underlying system: (A) professional contractors tracking costs across multiple client jobs to protect profitability, OR (B) homeowners managing major renovation projects to stay within budget.

**Your Assignment:** Choose ONE target audience (contractors OR homeowners) and create a brand that helps them track material costs by project, organize receipts, monitor budgets in real-time, and make informed financial decisions—whether protecting business profit margins or protecting personal renovation budgets.

**The Pedagogical Challenge:** This brief teaches students to understand market segmentation and audience choice. The same platform serves both audiences, but brand personality, messaging, visual identity, and deliverables will differ significantly based on your choice. This is intentional—it mirrors real-world scenarios where businesses must choose a primary market even when serving multiple segments.

**CRITICAL:** You must choose which audience to design for. The platform serves both, but your creative work will be fundamentally different depending on whether you're speaking to working contractors managing business profitability or families managing life's biggest home investment.

## Core Innovation: Project-Based Expense Tracking

**What makes Trusty different from every other expense tracker:**

Most expense apps track spending chronologically or by category ("$847 in Home Improvement"). Trusty tracks expenses **BY PROJECT**—whether that's a client job for a contractor or a room in a renovation for a homeowner.

This changes everything:
- **Contractors** can see: "The Martinez Kitchen job cost me $3,847 in materials against my $4,200 budget—I'm still profitable with $353 margin."
- **Homeowners** can see: "We've spent $18,200 on the kitchen out of our $21,500 budget—we have $3,300 left for appliances and finishing touches."

**Why this matters:**
- Generic expense tracking shows you spent money. Project-based tracking shows whether you're **protecting your business** (contractors) or **protecting your budget** (homeowners).
- The difference between tracking transactions and tracking **outcomes**.
- Between knowing what you spent and knowing whether you can **afford what's next**.

This is the fundamental innovation that differentiates Trusty from Mint, QuickBooks, or any home improvement store app.

## Target Audience: Choose Your Focus

### OPTION A: Professional Contractors (B2B Focus)

**Demographics:** Ages 25-60 | Contractors, construction workers, tradespeople (general contractors, electricians, plumbers, framers, roofers, HVAC, landscaping, remodeling) | Income $45K-$95K | Solo operators or small crew leads (2-10 people)

**Pain Points:** "I finished the job but somehow lost money" | "I can't prove to the client what materials actually cost" | "I'm buying materials from 3 different suppliers and losing track" | "I bid $8,500 for this bathroom, spent $9,200, ate the difference" | "I have no idea which jobs are profitable and which aren't" | "Receipts in my truck, my toolbox, my wallet—everywhere"

**Current Behavior:** Shoebox of receipts (if they keep them at all) | Estimating costs from memory weeks later | Realizing at tax time they lost money on multiple jobs | Underpricing bids because don't know actual costs | Can't prove material costs when clients dispute bills | Eating costs to maintain client relationships

**Use Case:** Tracking material costs across multiple simultaneous client jobs to protect profit margins, prove costs to clients, improve future bidding accuracy

**The Business Reality:** Contractors operate on thin margins—often 10-20% profit on a job. Losing track of $200 in materials means the difference between making money and working for free. They're skilled tradespeople, not accountants. They need tracking that's as reliable and durable as their tools, requiring minimal time investment but delivering maximum clarity about job profitability.

---

### OPTION B: Homeowners Managing Renovations (B2C Focus)

**Demographics:** Ages 30-65 | Homeowners undertaking major renovation projects (kitchen, bathroom, addition, whole-house remodel) | Household income $75K-$150K | Often using home improvement financing (Home Depot card, Lowe's card, HELOC, renovation loan)

**Pain Points:** "We're three months in and have no idea what we've actually spent" | "Are we going over budget? We don't know until it's too late" | "My spouse and I keep buying stuff without telling each other" | "We have $40K loan but don't know how much is left" | "Receipts everywhere—how will we return anything or file warranty claims?" | "The contractor says we owe more but we don't know if that's right"

**Current Behavior:** Rough budget in head or on napkin | Both spouses buying materials independently | Panic when credit card bill arrives | Spreadsheet abandoned after first month | Receipts in multiple places (car, kitchen drawer, already thrown away) | Realizing they're $15K over budget when it's too late to change anything

**Use Case:** Tracking all renovation costs for ONE big project to stay within budget/loan limit, maintain spouse transparency, organize receipts, make trade-off decisions

**The Family Reality:** A major renovation is often the biggest project (and expense) a family tackles together outside of buying the house itself. It tests relationships, stresses finances, and creates anxiety. Couples need transparency without conflict—both partners need to see the complete picture so they can make decisions together. Going over budget isn't just a number—it's taking money from retirement, college funds, or emergency savings.

---

## Universal Truth: Both Audiences Need Project-Based Expense Tracking

Whether tracking multiple client jobs OR tracking one home renovation project, the core need is the same: **know what you're spending, organize by project area, stay within budget, keep receipts accessible.**

The difference is context, stakes, and brand personality:

- **Contractors** = business survival, client relationships, profitability, professional credibility
- **Homeowners** = family finances, marriage harmony, dream home anxiety, lifestyle investment

**Students: Choose which audience resonates more with you and design for them.**

**Design Implication:** The same platform architecture serves both, but the brand voice, visual language, messaging hierarchy, and even terminology change based on audience:
- Contractors need "Job" | "Client" | "Bid" | "Profit Margin" | "Prove Costs"
- Homeowners need "Room" | "Project" | "Budget" | "Couple Transparency" | "Make Decisions"

## Meet the Founder: Carmen Silva

Carmen grew up watching her dad run a small plumbing business. He was a great plumber—terrible at business. Worked 60-hour weeks but was always broke. She saw him eat costs on jobs rather than argue with clients. Saw him underestimate material costs and lose money on every third job. When he retired, he'd been working 30 years and had almost nothing to show for it.

**Carmen's contractor journey:**
Carmen became an electrician, then general contractor. Determined not to repeat his mistakes. She tracked every material purchase meticulously in a ledger notebook—job name, supplier, cost, date. Knew exactly what every job cost her, what her profit margin was, whether she was pricing bids correctly. It worked. She was profitable. She could prove costs to clients who questioned bills. Her ledger system was her business lifeline.

**The transformation moment:**
Then at 34, she and her wife decided to renovate their 1950s bungalow—gut the kitchen, remodel both bathrooms, refinish floors. Suddenly Carmen was on the OTHER side. She wasn't the contractor, she was the client. They had a $45,000 budget (HELOC loan). She thought tracking would be easy—she did this professionally!

It was chaos. Her wife bought tile. Carmen bought fixtures. Contractor bought lumber. Plumber bought pipes. Separate trips to Home Depot, Lowe's, local suppliers. Receipts everywhere. Three months in, Carmen sat down to tally everything. They'd spent $38,000 and the kitchen wasn't even done. They were on track to go $20,000 over budget. Panic.

**The universal insight:**
She pulled out her contractor ledger method—started tracking everything by room (kitchen, bathroom 1, bathroom 2, floors). Organized all receipts. Saw exactly where money was going. Realized they could save $3,000 by choosing different tile. Made trade-offs. Finished the project $2,000 under budget.

**Her realization:** The same tracking system that saved her business could save homeowners' renovation budgets. Contractors need it for profitability. Homeowners need it for sanity. Both need to track expenses by project and know where they stand in real-time.

**Her philosophy:** "Whether it's your business or your home, you can't manage what you don't measure. Every project deserves a trusty system for tracking what you're spending."

**The result:** Trusty—project-based expense tracking via card, physical receipt organizer by project area, job tracking booklet, and mobile app with real-time budget alerts. Works for contractors tracking multiple jobs AND homeowners tracking one big renovation.

**Brand DNA from the founder story:**
- **Trusty** = like Carmen's ledger notebook—reliable, always there, never fails you
- **Respect for skilled work** = whether contractor or homeowner DIY, this is meaningful work that deserves proper tools
- **Learned from both sides** = understands contractor profitability AND homeowner budget anxiety
- **Physical + digital integration** = the ledger worked because it was tangible; combine that reliability with digital power
- **No judgment** = Carmen's dad wasn't irresponsible, he lacked a system. Neither are homeowners who go over budget.

## Dual-Market Strategy (For Context Only—You Choose One for Your Design)

**Why the platform serves both audiences:**
- Same core need: project-based expense tracking
- Same pain point: scattered receipts, budget chaos, unclear financial picture
- Same solution: automatic capture + project organization + real-time visibility

**How the platform adapts:**
- **Database**: Same expense tracking engine, different configuration layer
- **Terminology**: "Job" vs. "Room" | "Client" vs. "Project" | "Bid" vs. "Budget"
- **Features**: Profit margin calculation (contractors) vs. Couple transparency (homeowners)
- **Brand personality**: Professional credibility (contractors) vs. Family-friendly reliability (homeowners)

**Your task as a designer:**
Choose your audience and commit fully. Don't try to split the difference—make every creative decision for ONE audience. The platform architecture allows both, but your brand work must be focused.

**Portfolio value:**
Demonstrating that you understand market segmentation, audience choice, and how to create cohesive brand identity for a specific target market while acknowledging the underlying technology serves multiple segments.

# PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

## What Is Trusty?

Project-based expense tracking system combining proprietary payment card (personal or business account), physical receipt organizer by project, job tracking booklet, and mobile app = **automatic expense capture** at point of purchase + **project/area categorization** for budget accuracy + **real-time budget alerts** + **organized receipt storage** for returns/warranties/proof.

Think: Every material purchase automatically documented, categorized by which project or room it's for, with immediate visibility into whether you're on budget (homeowners) or profitable (contractors). No more guessing, no more surprises.

**The Complete System Philosophy:**
Trusty isn't just an app. It's a complete system that integrates physical and digital tools because both matter. Contractors need physical receipt organization for job sites and client documentation. Homeowners need physical backup for warranty claims and returns. The booklet provides immediate job site logging when you need to write something down now. The card makes tracking automatic. The app provides real-time intelligence. Together, they create a complete tracking ecosystem.

---

## The Complete System

### Physical Components

**1. Trusty Card (Payment Card)**

**For Contractors:**

- Business card linked to contractor's business account
- Every material purchase tracked automatically
- Works at all suppliers (Home Depot Pro, Lowe's Pro, local lumber yards, electrical supply, plumbing supply)
- Replaces scattered personal cards and cash purchases
- Professional look—respectable at supplier counters
- Durable construction for daily trade use

**For Homeowners:**

- Personal card OR co-branded with home improvement financing (Home Depot card, Lowe's card)
- Linked to renovation budget/loan
- Both spouses can have cards linked to same account (transparency)
- Every renovation purchase tracked automatically
- Looks and feels like quality financial product—not "store card"
- Durable enough for renovation site conditions

**Either mode:** Transaction appears in app instantly | Prompts "which project/room?" | Receipt documentation automatic | No manual entry needed

**Design Considerations:**
- Should contractor version look different from homeowner version? (Professional vs. personal aesthetic)
- Card name on front: "Trusty Pro" vs. "Trusty Home"? Or unified "Trusty" branding?
- Material durability: Job site wear (contractor) vs. wallet/purse wear (homeowner)
- Co-branding opportunity: Possible partnership with Home Depot/Lowe's for homeowner market?
- Premium or practical aesthetic based on chosen audience

**2. Job Tracking Booklet (Physical Quick-Reference)**

- Durable notebook (~5" x 8", fits in toolbox, truck console, or purse)
- Pre-printed templates: Job/Room Name | Date | Supplier | Materials | Cost | Notes
- For quick logging on site when card isn't used (cash payments, tips, parking)
- Contractors: separate page per job
- Homeowners: separate page per room/area
- Tear-out sheets for record-keeping
- Weather-resistant cover (job site durability)

**Why physical booklet matters:**
- Job sites don't always have reliable phone access or clean hands for app use
- Writing things down creates memory reinforcement
- Immediate capture prevents forgetting
- Physical backup when digital fails
- Can show clients what was purchased and when

**Design Considerations:**
- Cover aesthetic: Rugged workbook (contractor) vs. Home project planner (homeowner)?
- Internal layout: Quick data capture vs. Reflection and planning space?
- Binding: Spiral for job site durability? Perfect-bound for home shelf storage?
- Size: Truly pocket-sized vs. Desktop reference?

**3. Receipt Organizer by Project (Physical Filing System)**

- Expandable accordion folder (~10" x 13")
- Labeled sections: customizable by project/room
- **For Contractors:** "Johnson Deck" | "Martinez Kitchen" | "Lee Bathroom" | "Williams Addition" | "Supplies/General"
- **For Homeowners:** "Kitchen" | "Primary Bath" | "Guest Bath" | "Floors" | "Exterior" | "Misc"
- Even with digital tracking, need physical receipts for returns, warranties, client documentation, audits
- Durable material (withstands truck/garage/construction site storage)

**Why physical receipt organization matters:**
- Returns require original receipts
- Warranty claims need documentation
- Contractors need to show clients proof of costs
- Tax time requires organized business expenses (contractors) or capital improvement documentation (homeowners)
- Home inspectors and insurance may require proof of materials used
- Digital photos fade or get lost in phone galleries—physical organization persists

**Design Considerations:**
- Material: Heavy-duty plastic (contractor job site) vs. Quality fabric/leather (homeowner home office)?
- Labeling: Write-on surface vs. Interchangeable label pockets?
- Size: Truck-friendly vs. Bookshelf-friendly?
- Visual identity: Tool aesthetic (contractor) vs. Home organization aesthetic (homeowner)?

### Digital Components

**4. Mobile App (Automatic Tracking & Budget Monitoring)**

**Dashboard (Adapts to User Type):**

**For Contractors:**

- Active jobs list with budget status for each
- "Martinez Kitchen: $3,847 spent of $4,200 budget | 89% used | $353 remaining"

- Creates real-time budget visibility
- Enables immediate decision-making for next purchase
- Teaches healthy financial awareness through repetition

**Real-Time Budget Alerts:**

**For Contractors:**

- "⚠️ The Martinez Kitchen project is at 89% of budget ($3,847 of $4,200). You need $200 more in materials. Adjust bid or eat the cost?"
- "✅ Great job! The Johnson Deck came in $340 under budget. Profit margin: 18%."
- "🚨 Budget alert: You're about to buy $180 in materials for the Lee Bathroom, but you've already spent $3,950 of your $3,800 budget. This job is losing money."
- "📊 Weekly summary: You completed 3 jobs this week. 2 were profitable, 1 went over budget by $220."

**For Homeowners:**

- "⚠️ Kitchen spending is at 85% of budget ($18,200 of $21,500). You have $3,300 left for appliances and finishing touches."
- "🚨 Budget alert: This $1,200 light fixture purchase would put your Kitchen over budget by $850. Can you choose something less expensive, or take from another room's budget?"
- "✅ Good news! Your bathroom remodel came in $600 under budget. You can reallocate that to the kitchen or save it."
- "💰 Overall project status: You're 72% through your budget with an estimated 15% of work remaining. You're on track to finish within budget!"

**Alert tone considerations:**
- **Contractors**: Professional, data-focused, actionable—"here's the number, here's your choice"
- **Homeowners**: Supportive, judgment-free, collaborative—"let's figure this out together"
- **Both**: Never shame, always inform and empower

**Project/Room Management:**

## Why This Works When Others Don't

**Problem:** "I don't know if this job made me money or lost me money" (Contractors)
**Solution:** Automatic tracking by job with profit margin calculation—see profitability in real-time, not months later

**Problem:** "We have no idea if we're staying within our renovation budget" (Homeowners)
**Solution:** Real-time budget tracking with alerts before you overspend—catch budget issues early enough to adjust

**Problem:** "Receipts are scattered across my truck, wallet, and toolbox" (Contractors)
**Solution:** Physical organizer by job + digital backup—everything in one place, accessible when needed

**Problem:** "My spouse and I keep buying stuff without telling each other" (Homeowners)
**Solution:** Shared app access, both see all purchases instantly—transparency without interrogation

**Problem:** "I can't prove to the client what materials actually cost" (Contractors)
**Solution:** Organized receipts by job, digital and physical documentation—pull up proof in 30 seconds

**Problem:** "We're three months into renovation and just realized we're $10K over budget" (Homeowners)
**Solution:** Real-time alerts catch budget issues before they become catastrophic—adjust while you still can

**Problem:** "I spend hours tracking expenses in a ledger every week" (Contractors)
**Solution:** Automatic capture via card, minimal manual entry—spend time on jobs, not bookkeeping

**Problem:** "I started a spreadsheet but abandoned it after two weeks" (Homeowners)
**Solution:** Automatic tracking, no manual data entry required—system maintains itself

**Problem:** "Generic expense apps don't understand construction/renovation" (Both)
**Solution:** Built specifically for project-based tracking—categories, workflows, and terminology that match your reality

**Competitive Landscape:**

- **QuickBooks/FreshBooks** (Contractors): Complex accounting software designed for accountants, not tradespeople. Requires significant time investment. Doesn't organize physical receipts.
- **Mint/YNAB** (Homeowners): Monthly budgeting that doesn't work for one-time renovation project. No project-based categorization. No physical receipt organization.
- **Home Depot/Lowe's Apps** (Both): Only tracks purchases at ONE store. No complete project picture. No budget intelligence.
- **Spreadsheets** (Both): Manual data entry leads to abandonment. No real-time alerts. No automatic capture. Error-prone.
- **Shoeboxes/Ledgers** (Both): Physical only, no analysis, time-consuming, hard to search.

**Trusty's Unique Position:**
The only solution that combines automatic digital tracking with physical organization, built specifically for project-based expense management, serving both contractor profitability and homeowner budget protection.

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

## User Stories (Choose scenarios matching your target audience)

### Contractor-Focused Stories:

**DeShawn, 38, General Contractor:** Runs small renovation company, 4-person crew, makes $78K. Does 3-5 jobs simultaneously (kitchens, bathrooms, decks, additions). Keeping materials straight is nightmare—bought tile for Johnson job, accidentally installed at Martinez job, had to eat the cost. Last year realized he lost money on 40% of his jobs because underestimated material costs. Had spreadsheet for tracking but too busy to update. Jobs that he thought made $2,000 profit actually lost $400. Almost went under.

**How Trusty helps:** Every material purchase tagged to correct job at point of purchase | Can see in real-time which jobs are on budget vs. bleeding money | Physical receipts organized by job—can prove costs to clients | Historical data helps him bid more accurately | Profit margin visibility shows him which job types are actually profitable.

**Design takeaway:** Speak to working contractors who can't spend hours on bookkeeping—emphasize speed, durability, practical utility. Show real job sites, dirty hands, truck storage. Blue-collar authentic without stereotyping. Must feel trustworthy and reliable like their tools. Professional credibility matters—clients and suppliers see this card and app. Visual language: Durable, honest, straightforward, competent.

**Rosa, 51, Electrician:** Licensed electrician, solo operator, makes $71K. Does residential and commercial work—new construction, renovations, service calls. Buys materials from electrical supply houses, Home Depot, specialty suppliers. Tried keeping receipts but they fade, get lost in truck, covered in dirt. Tax time is nightmare—can't document what she spent. One client disputed her bill, said materials cost too much. She couldn't prove actual costs, ate $1,200 to keep the relationship. Now keeps meticulous records in Trusty—every wire spool, every fixture, every box, tagged to job.

**How Trusty helps:** Digital receipt capture (faded paper doesn't matter) | Organized by job—can pull up any past job instantly | Tax time: exports all business expenses | Client disputes: can show exactly what was spent | Weather-proof organizer withstands job site conditions.

**Design takeaway:** Speak to trades beyond general contractors—electricians, plumbers, HVAC. Emphasize professional credibility, client trust, tax documentation. Show respect for skilled trades. Can't feel corporate or condescending. These are business professionals who work with their hands—design should honor both aspects. Visual language: Skilled, precise, professional, dependable.

### Homeowner-Focused Stories:

**Jen & Marcus, 34 & 36, Homeowners:** Bought 1970s split-level, gutting kitchen and both bathrooms, $52K budget (HELOC). Both work full-time, have two kids. Jen buys tile at lunch. Marcus stops at Home Depot after work. Contractor buying lumber. Plumber ordering fixtures. Three months in, Jen tried to total everything—receipts in her car, Marcus's truck, kitchen drawer, some already thrown out. Best guess: $41K spent. Still need appliances ($8K), countertops ($6K), flooring ($4K). They're going to be $7K over budget and kitchen isn't done. Panic. Argument. Marcus blamed Jen for "expensive tile." Jen blamed Marcus for "too many Home Depot trips."

**How Trusty helps:** Both have Trusty cards—see every purchase in real-time | No more surprise spending | "Kitchen: $28K spent of $30K budget" alerts them before over | Make trade-offs: chose less expensive flooring to save $2K | Finished $1,500 under budget | Marriage survived renovation.

**Design takeaway:** Speak to couples managing major life project together—emphasize transparency, partnership, reducing relationship stress. Show both partners engaged. Can't feel condescending to non-professionals. Homeowners are smart, just not contractors. This is their biggest home investment—treat it with respect. Visual language: Collaborative, transparent, reassuring, empowering.

**Tom, 58, Homeowner:** Retired teacher, renovating lake cabin himself (DIY project). $28K budget (savings). Doing most work himself, hiring out plumbing and electrical. Buying materials as he goes—lumber, drywall, tile, fixtures, tools. Started spreadsheet to track spending. Abandoned it week 3 (too busy actually working). Six months in, realized he had no idea what he'd spent. Guessed $24K? Turns out $31K. Blown budget by $3K and cabin still needs deck, dock repairs. Had to take money from emergency fund. Wished he'd tracked from day one.

**How Trusty helps:** Automatic tracking even for DIY—every Home Depot run documented | Budget alerts would've caught overspending on materials early | Could've made different choices (cheaper flooring, used fixture instead of new) | Physical organizer keeps receipts for warranty claims when stuff breaks | Next project (kitchen at home) will use Trusty from start.

**Design takeaway:** Speak to DIY homeowners doing work themselves—respect their skills and initiative. Emphasize budget protection for people working with fixed savings. Show pride in DIY work. Can't feel like it's only for people hiring contractors. Visual language: Capable, practical, achievement-oriented, resourceful.

## What Motivates Purchase

**Trigger Events:**

**For Contractors:** Realized they lost money on a job | Client disputed bill, couldn't prove costs | Tax time chaos with no organized records | Underbid a job because didn't know actual costs | Competitor using better tracking and undercutting prices | Want to grow business but finances are chaotic | Accountant recommended better expense tracking

**For Homeowners:** Starting major renovation project | Got approved for home improvement loan/HELOC | Heard horror stories about budget overruns | Spouse insisted on transparency | Previous renovation went way over budget | Want to DIY but need to stay organized | Contractor recommended tracking system

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:**

**For Both:** Spreadsheets (manual entry, easy to abandon, time-consuming) | Shoeboxes of receipts (disorganized, receipts fade/get lost, can't find anything) | Memory ("I think I spent around…") | Generic expense apps (not built for project-based tracking, no physical receipt organization)

**For Contractors:** Handwritten ledgers (time-consuming, can't generate reports, hard to analyze profitability trends) | Accounting software (too complex, designed for accountants not contractors, expensive) | Banking apps (show transactions but don't categorize by job) | No system to prove costs to clients

**For Homeowners:** "Winging it" (no system, hope for the best, get surprised by overspending) | One partner tracking, other not (lack of transparency causes conflict) | Home improvement store apps (track purchases at ONE store but they buy from multiple places) | Monthly budgeting apps (renovation is project-based, not monthly)

**Emotional Drivers:**

**For Contractors:**
- **Fear**: Losing money without knowing it, client disputes, tax audit without documentation
- **Frustration**: Working hard but not making money, poor bidding accuracy
- **Aspiration**: Running a truly profitable business, professional credibility, growth
- **Relief**: Finally knowing which jobs make money, proving costs easily

**For Homeowners:**
- **Anxiety**: Going over budget, running out of money mid-project
- **Relationship stress**: Conflict over spending, lack of transparency
- **Aspiration**: Dream home within budget, pride in accomplishment
- **Relief**: Making it through renovation without financial disaster or divorce

## Research Guidance: No Handed Answers

**Audience Research:**

**For Contractors:** Reddit (r/Construction, r/Contractor, r/electricians, r/smallbusiness), trade forums, LinkedIn groups (contractors, tradespeople), YouTube (contractor channels).

**Find:** How do contractors talk about profitability? Common mistakes that lose money? Pain points with tracking? Bidding challenges? Client dispute stories? What tools do they trust? How do they talk about their work? What earns respect vs. what feels condescending?

**For Homeowners:** Reddit (r/HomeImprovement, r/Renovations, r/DIY), Houzz forums, Pinterest (renovation planning), Facebook groups (home renovation, DIY).

**Find:** Budget anxiety language? Couples' financial conflicts during renovations? Stories of going over budget? Organization challenges? Decision-making struggles? What resources do they trust? How do couples talk about money? What's reassuring vs. patronizing?

**Competitive Research:** Contractor apps (Jobber, Buildertrend, CoConstruct), expense tracking (QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Mint), home improvement store apps (Home Depot, Lowe's), renovation planning apps (Houzz, Sweeten).

**Find:** Visual territory—professional/corporate OR consumer-friendly? **Who does project-based tracking well? Who makes budget monitoring stress-free? Who serves your chosen audience authentically?** What features matter most? What gets abandoned? Where do they fail?

**Visual Research:** Dribbble/Behance (construction tech, home improvement apps, project management), Pinterest (tool aesthetics, home renovation planning), actual retail (Pro Desk displays, home improvement aisles).

**Find:** **What visual language speaks to contractors—rugged, reliable, no-BS? OR What speaks to homeowners—aspirational but practical, organized, calming?** What colors work for your audience? Typography that conveys trustworthiness? Photography styles that resonate?

**Market Research:** Statistics for your chosen audience: contractor profit margins and common losses, material cost tracking practices OR homeowner renovation budgets and typical overruns, home improvement financing, DIY vs. contractor hiring rates.

**Sources:** Construction industry reports, NAHB (National Association of Home Builders), home improvement retailer data, renovation surveys, trade association data.

**Specific data to find:**
- **Contractors**: Average profit margins by trade, percentage of jobs that lose money, cost overrun frequency, client dispute rates
- **Homeowners**: Average renovation budgets by project type, percentage that go over budget, average overrun amount, common financial mistakes

## Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need:** Card technical specs (contractor business account vs. homeowner personal account), app architecture (**how project tagging works instantly**, budget tracking algorithms, **contractor profit calculation OR homeowner budget monitoring**, receipt OCR), integration requirements (accounting software for contractors OR home improvement store accounts for homeowners).

**What they need:** Brand assets (logos, colors, typography), UI specs (**interface differs significantly by audience**—contractor dashboard vs. homeowner dashboard, terminology changes, contractor features vs. couple features), UX considerations (**how make project tagging effortless on job site with dirty hands OR at store checkout with screaming kids**, budget alert wording for your audience).

**Critical handoffs:**

**Visual Assets:**
- Logo files (SVG, PNG, various sizes)
- Color palette with hex codes and usage guidelines
- Typography specs (fonts, sizes, weights, hierarchy)
- Icon library (project, receipt, budget, etc.)
- Photography style guide and sample images

**Interface Specifications:**
- Wireframes for all key screens
- Component library (buttons, cards, forms, alerts)
- Interaction patterns (how tagging works, how alerts appear)
- Responsive design specs (mobile-first, tablet, desktop for contractor dashboard)
- Accessibility requirements

**Content and Copy:**
- All UI copy based on chosen audience (button labels, headings, alerts, empty states)
- Alert message templates with appropriate tone
- Error messages that match brand voice
- Onboarding flow copy
- Help documentation

**User Experience Documentation:**
- User flows for primary tasks (add transaction, create project, view budget)
- Edge cases and error states
- Loading states and progressive disclosure
- Notification frequency and timing
- Accessibility considerations (job site gloves, bright sunlight, etc.)

**How to work together:**

Regular check-ins, be very clear which audience you're designing for, explain rationale for audience-specific features, share work in progress, discuss feasibility of dual-market platform with different interfaces, document decisions.

**Recommended rhythm:**
- **Sprint Planning**: Designers show upcoming screen mockups, developers assess technical feasibility
- **Mid-Sprint Check-in**: Designers share refined designs, developers show work in progress
- **Sprint Review**: Both demonstrate completed work, identify integration issues
- **Retrospective**: Discuss what's working in collaboration, what needs improvement

**Common collaboration challenges:**
- **Terminology consistency**: Create shared vocabulary document—what designers call "project card" developers might call "expense_collection_widget"
- **Scope management**: Be clear about MVP vs. nice-to-have features
- **Technical constraints**: Some design ideas may not be technically feasible—maintain open dialogue
- **Dual-audience complexity**: Ensure both understand how contractor vs. homeowner versions differ

## Final Reminders

**Choose your audience and commit.** Don't try to design for both—pick contractors OR homeowners and make every decision for them. Brand personality, messaging, visuals, deliverables all differ dramatically.

**Avoid stereotypes.** If choosing contractors: blue-collar doesn't mean unsophisticated, show respect for skilled work, don't condescend. If choosing homeowners: DIY doesn't mean clueless, renovation stress is real and valid, don't make them feel inadequate.

**"Trusty" must feel trusty.** Reliable, durable, dependable, always works. Like their favorite hammer or their best friend. Not flashy, just solid. This brand promise must come through in every touchpoint.

**Project-based tracking is the differentiator.** Every other tool tracks expenses. Trusty tracks expenses BY PROJECT. For contractors: protects profitability. For homeowners: prevents budget disasters. This is the unique value—emphasize it constantly.

**Physical + digital integration matters.** Not just an app. Physical receipt organizer and job booklet matter. Show how physical and digital work together seamlessly. This isn't just another fintech app—it's a complete system that respects both analog and digital needs.

**Respect the work.** Whether contractor building decks or homeowner renovating their kitchen, this is skilled, meaningful work. Design should honor that effort and show respect for the financial stakes involved. Contractors are business professionals. Homeowners are making their biggest investment. Neither should feel talked down to.

**Dual-market understanding demonstrates sophistication.** Even though you're choosing one audience, showing awareness of how the platform serves both demonstrates strategic thinking. Include one slide/page explaining dual-market strategy, then focus everything else on your chosen audience.

**Every decision needs rationale.** "I chose _______ because _______" rooted in: chosen audience needs, project tracking emphasis, budget protection, trustworthiness, practical utility, respect for skilled work, physical/digital integration.

**Voice consistency across all touchpoints.** Whether it's the card design, app alerts, packaging copy, or social media posts—the brand voice must be consistent. Contractors hear professional competence. Homeowners hear supportive partnership. But both hear "trustworthy and reliable."

**Real-world validation.** Test your concepts with actual contractors or homeowners if possible. Does a contractor look at your app design and say "I'd use that"? Does a homeowner couple see themselves in your marketing materials?

**Portfolio-worthy work.** Demonstrates: audience choice and commitment, dual-market understanding, industry-specific design, physical + digital system thinking, authentic voice for chosen audience, strategic brand development. Do work you're proud to show.

**Keep asking:**
- Does this feel authentic to contractors OR homeowners (whichever you chose)?
- Does "trusty" come through—reliable, dependable, always there?
- Does project-based tracking get emphasized as the core differentiator?
- Would your chosen audience actually use this?
- Does physical + digital integration make sense?
- Does this respect the work and the workers?
- Can I defend every decision based on my chosen audience's needs?
- If someone from my chosen audience looked at this, would they say "This gets me"?
