# CREATIVE BRIEF: POCKETBACK BUSINESS EXPENSE MANAGEMENT

-----

# PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

## Project Overview

Create a complete brand identity and product system for **PocketBack**—a business expense management platform that serves employees who front their own money for business expenses AND employees with corporate cards who need to document and report spending.

**Your Assignment:** Create a brand that empowers employees to manage business expenses efficiently, protect their personal finances from cash flow crises, track expenses by project/client for billing accuracy, and eliminate the administrative nightmare of expense reporting—whether they’re fronting their own money or using company funds.

-----

## Target Audience: Employees Managing Business Expenses

**Demographics:** Ages 25-55 | Income $50K-$95K | Industries: sales reps, consultants, field service technicians, construction project managers, freelancers/contractors working for multiple companies

**Two Primary User Types:**

**Type 1: Personal Reimbursement Users** (fronting own money)

- Use personal credit card or cash for business expenses
- Wait weeks (sometimes months) for reimbursement
- Often fronting $2,000-$5,000+ at a time
- Risk: Cash flow crisis—can’t pay personal bills while waiting for company to reimburse

**Type 2: Corporate Card Users** (company money)

- Have company expense account or corporate card
- Not fronting own money BUT still responsible for documentation, categorization, reporting
- Risk: Budget overruns, lost receipts, expense report errors could get them fired
- Administrative burden—hours spent on expense reports

**Universal Pain Points:** “I spent $3,200 this month and still haven’t been reimbursed” | “I can’t remember which client this receipt was for” | “I almost couldn’t pay rent because I’m floating company expenses” | “I spent 6 hours doing expense reports instead of actual work” | “I lost track of $1,800 in billable expenses—worked for free” | “My corporate card is maxed and I need to buy materials for tomorrow’s job”

**Current Behavior:** Using personal cards and hoping for fast reimbursement (doesn’t happen) | Shoebox of crumpled receipts | Spreadsheet hell at month-end | Forgetting which expense goes to which project/client | Losing billable expenses (can’t prove what was spent) | Anxiety about budget limits on corporate cards | Hours on expense report administrative work

## Meet the Founder: Jasmine Rodriguez

Early career: Jasmine was a sales rep traveling constantly. She’d rack up $3,000-$4,000 monthly in flights, hotels, client dinners. Used her personal credit card. Company reimbursement took 6-8 weeks. She was essentially giving her employer an interest-free loan of thousands of dollars while paying credit card interest herself. One month hit $4,800 in unreimbursed expenses. Rent was due. Checking account had $720. She put rent on her credit card. Waited another 3 weeks for reimbursement. Racked up $180 in interest charges on money she spent *for her job*. Almost quit.

Mid-career: She moved to consulting, got a corporate card (relief—no more fronting her own money!). But new nightmare: managing expenses across 4 different client projects simultaneously. Bought materials for Client A, forgot to note it, accidentally billed Client B. Lost $2,300 in expenses over 6 months because couldn’t prove which client they belonged to—essentially worked for free. Spent 8-10 hours monthly doing expense reports, categorizing receipts, chasing approvals. Her billable rate was $150/hour. She was losing $1,200-$1,500/month in billable time to administrative busywork.

The breaking point: Same week she discovered she’d lost those billable expenses, her corporate card was declined at a hardware store because she’d hit her quarterly limit without realizing it. Standing there, embarrassed, calling her manager for approval, client waiting. She realized: **whether it’s your money or company money, the system is broken.**

**Her philosophy:** “Employees shouldn’t have to choose between doing their job and paying their rent. And they shouldn’t lose money because expense tracking is designed for accountants, not for the people actually spending the money.”

**The result:** PocketBack—automatic receipt capture via card transactions, project/client tracking at point of purchase, real-time alerts about reimbursement status and budget limits, instant expense reports, physical receipt organization by project. Whether you’re fronting your own money or using a corporate card, PocketBack protects you.

-----

## Brand Positioning & Key Messages

**Positioning:** For employees (ages 25-55) who manage business expenses—whether fronting personal money awaiting reimbursement or using corporate cards requiring documentation—who face cash flow crises, lost billable expenses, and administrative burden, PocketBack is a business expense management system that automatically captures receipts via proprietary card, tracks expenses by project/client for accurate billing, provides real-time alerts about reimbursement status and budget limits, and generates instant expense reports. Unlike traditional expense software designed for accounting departments or basic receipt apps that don’t track project context, PocketBack protects employees’ personal finances, maximizes billable expense recovery, and eliminates hours of administrative work through automatic project-based tracking at point of purchase.

**Brand Promise:** “Your money, back in your pocket. Your time, back in your day.”

**Key Messages:**

1. Stop fronting thousands in business expenses—see exactly what you’re owed and when to expect it
1. Never lose billable expenses again—track by project/client automatically at point of purchase
1. Budget alerts protect you—know before you overspend on corporate card
1. Expense reports in seconds, not hours—automatic categorization by project
1. Whether it’s your money or company money, PocketBack protects your financial well-being

# PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

## What Is PocketBack?

Business expense management system combining proprietary payment card (personal reimbursement OR corporate expense account), physical receipt organizer by project, and smart mobile app = **automatic expense tracking** at point of purchase + **project/client categorization** for billing accuracy + **real-time alerts** about reimbursement status and budget limits + **instant expense reports** eliminating administrative burden.

Think: Every business expense automatically documented, categorized by which project/client it’s for, with immediate visibility into when you’ll get your money back (if fronting) or whether you’re within budget (if corporate card). Hours of expense report work reduced to seconds.

## Why This Works When Others Don’t

**Problem:** “I front thousands in business expenses and don’t know when I’ll be reimbursed” → **Solution:** Real-time tracking of unreimbursed amounts with reimbursement status alerts and expected payment dates

**Problem:** “I can’t remember which expense goes to which client/project” → **Solution:** Categorize by project AT POINT OF PURCHASE, not weeks later during expense report hell

**Problem:** “I lose billable expenses because I can’t prove which client they’re for” → **Solution:** Every expense tagged to project automatically, easy to generate client-specific billing reports

**Problem:** “My corporate card got declined because I didn’t realize I was near my limit” → **Solution:** Real-time budget tracking with alerts before you overspend

**Problem:** “I spend 8 hours a month on expense reports” → **Solution:** Automatic categorization and one-click expense report generation

**Problem:** “I have a shoebox of receipts and no idea which are for which project” → **Solution:** Physical organizer by project + digital backup means nothing gets lost

**Problem:** “My company’s expense software is designed for accountants, not for me” → **Solution:** Employee-first design focused on speed, clarity, and protection

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

## User Stories (Composite Characters)

**Derek, 32, Field Service Technician:** HVAC installer, makes $62K. Constantly buying materials and tools for jobs—sometimes $500-$1,200 per job. Uses personal credit card. Company reimburses but takes 4-6 weeks. Last month fronted $4,200 across 7 jobs. Reimbursement came late—he overdrafted his account trying to pay bills. Credit score took a hit. Also lost $680 in materials he bought for the Martinez job because lost the receipt—company won’t reimburse without documentation. **How PocketBack helps:** Every purchase tracked automatically via card | Categorized by job at point of purchase | Can see he’s owed $4,200 and reimbursement is 12 days overdue—alerts let him follow up with office | Physical receipts organized by job in envelope system | Never loses billable materials again | Cash flow alerts warn him before fronting more than he can afford. **Design takeaway:** Speak to blue-collar workers managing multiple job sites—emphasize time savings (they’re paid to fix HVAC, not do paperwork), financial protection from fronting, job-specific tracking for billing accuracy. Visuals should show real work environments, respect their expertise, focus on practical utility over flashy features.

**Priya, 29, Sales Consultant:** Enterprise software sales, makes $78K base + commission. Travels constantly—flights, hotels, client dinners. Company issued her corporate card (doesn’t front own money). But still nightmare: has monthly $3,000 travel budget, quarterly $5,000 entertainment budget. Last quarter accidentally went over entertainment budget by $890 because wasn’t tracking carefully. Got reprimanded. Had to justify every dinner. Almost got put on warning. Also managing expenses across 12 active prospects—needed to know which dinners went to which deals for her commission tracking and manager reporting. Spent 6-8 hours monthly doing expense reports. **How PocketBack helps:** Real-time budget tracking—sees she’s spent $2,650 of $3,000 travel budget | Gets alert before booking hotel that would put her over | Every dinner tagged to specific prospect/deal at point of purchase | Automatic expense reports by prospect for her manager | What took 6 hours now takes 10 minutes. **Design takeaway:** Speak to corporate employees with expense accounts—emphasize budget protection (avoid getting in trouble), career advancement (more time selling, less time on admin), professional image (organized, on top of finances). Visuals should be polished and corporate-appropriate while still being employee-focused.

**Marcus, 44, Independent Contractor:** Does residential electrical work for 3 different general contractors. Makes ~$85K. Uses personal card for materials—wire, fixtures, breakers, etc. Each contractor has different reimbursement process (one pays weekly, one pays on project completion, one pays 30 days after invoice). He’s constantly juggling $6K-$8K in unreimbursed materials across multiple jobs for multiple contractors. Last month Contractor B went bankrupt—he’s out $3,400 in materials he’ll never be reimbursed for. Also scrambling at tax time because needs to separate which expenses are reimbursed vs. which are his business expenses. **How PocketBack helps:** Tracks expenses by contractor AND by specific job | Can see exactly what Contractor B owes him vs. what Contractor A owes him | Physical receipt organizer by job means he can pull all documentation if contractor disputes expenses | Tax time: can easily generate report of unreimbursed expenses (his loss) vs. reimbursed expenses (not deductible) | Budget alerts warn him if he’s fronting too much to one contractor. **Design takeaway:** Speak to independent contractors and freelancers managing multiple clients—emphasize financial protection from client non-payment, tax documentation organization, client-specific expense tracking. Must handle complexity of multiple payment sources and policies. Visuals should show autonomy and professional business management.

**Angela, 37, Project Manager (Construction):** Manages commercial construction projects for mid-size firm, makes $72K. Has corporate card ($5,000 monthly limit) for project expenses—supplies, subcontractor deposits, permit fees. Managing 4 active projects simultaneously. Nightmare: bought lumber for Project A, forgot to note it, accidentally charged it to Project B’s budget. Client B disputed bill. Angela had to eat the cost. Spent 2 weeks reconstructing which expenses went to which project. Nearly lost her job. Also company requires detailed expense reports for each project for client billing and profit tracking. Takes her 10-12 hours monthly. **How PocketBack helps:** At checkout, app asks “Which project?” immediately—tags to correct project before she even leaves store | Physical envelope system organized by project name | Can instantly generate expense report for any project for client billing | Budget tracking per project—knows exactly how much each project has spent vs. budget | What took 10-12 hours monthly now takes 30 minutes. **Design takeaway:** Speak to project managers juggling multiple clients/projects—emphasize accuracy (client billing depends on it), time savings (more time managing projects, less on paperwork), career protection (errors can get you fired). Show organized, systematic approach. Visuals should convey control and professional competence across complex situations.

## What Motivates Purchase

**Trigger Events:** Cash flow crisis (can’t pay personal bills because fronting too much in business expenses) | Lost billable expenses (worked for free because couldn’t document project expenses) | Budget overrun (went over corporate card limit, got in trouble with management) | Month-end expense report hell (spent entire weekend categorizing receipts) | Client billing dispute (can’t prove what was spent on their project) | Tax nightmare (can’t separate reimbursed vs. business expenses) | Receipt panic (lost critical receipt, reimbursement denied)

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:** Traditional expense software (Concur, SAP Concur, Certify) designed for accounting departments not employees—clunky, time-consuming, requires manual entry | Receipt apps (Expensify, Shoeboxed) capture receipts but don’t track by project/client—still have to categorize everything manually later | Spreadsheets (manual tracking nightmare, easy to make errors, time-consuming) | Corporate cards alone (no project tracking, no visibility into budget limits until it’s too late, no protection for personal reimbursement users) | Banking apps (show transactions but don’t categorize by business project, don’t generate expense reports)

-----

LinkedIn for B2B? What do employees share—relief from reimbursement stress? time saved on expense reports? billable expenses recovered?) | Website Landing Page (dual audience—individual employees searching for solution AND HR/finance departments buying for company—how address both? separate landing pages or one with sections for each?) | Email Campaign (min 3—onboarding for new users? tips for project tracking? celebrating time/money saved? different campaigns for personal reimbursement vs. corporate users?) | Digital Ads (min 6—where run? LinkedIn? Industry websites? what hook—fronting money pain? lost billable expenses? budget protection? time savings?) | App Store Presence (screenshots—which features first? project tracking? budget alerts? expense report generation? appeal to employee pain points) | Animated Explainer (storyboard—how show dual use case without confusing? what emotional arc—from stress/chaos to relief/control?)

-----

## Research Guidance: No Handed Answers

**Audience Research:** Reddit (r/sales, r/consulting, r/Construction, r/electricians, r/personalfinance looking for expense fronting complaints), LinkedIn groups (sales professionals, field service, consultants), industry forums. Find: How do people in these roles talk about expense reimbursement? What’s the language—frustration, resignation, humor, anger? How much are they fronting? How long do they wait? What stories of lost billable expenses? What budget limit disasters with corporate cards?

**Competitive Research:** Traditional expense software (Concur, Certify, Chrome River, Coupa), receipt apps (Expensify, Shoeboxed, Receipt Bank), corporate card providers (Brex, Ramp, Divvy), project management tools with expense features. Find: Visual territory—corporate/stuffy or modern/employee-friendly? Messaging—built for CFOs or for employees? **Who handles project tracking well? Who protects employee cash flow? Who makes expense reporting actually fast?** Where are gaps?

**Visual Research:** Dribbble/Behance (fintech, B2B tools, productivity apps), Awwwards, Pinterest (professional tools, blue-collar work environments, corporate/field service hybrid imagery), actual retail (office supply stores, corporate services—how are B2B2E tools marketed?). Find: What visual language says “professional” without “corporate boring”? How show dual use cases without confusion? **What imagery respects both office workers and field service workers?** Colors that feel trustworthy and efficient?

**Market Research:** Statistics on employee expense fronting amounts and timelines, percentage of employees using personal cards for business expenses, lost billable expenses across industries, time spent on expense reporting, corporate card usage and limits, project-based industries (construction, consulting, field service). Sources: Business expense management studies, employee satisfaction surveys, industry reports, corporate travel associations, project management research.

## Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need:** Card technical specs (personal vs. corporate mode differences, budget limit enforcement, spending alerts), app architecture (how project tagging works at point of purchase, **how dual use cases are handled in same app**, reimbursement tracking vs. budget tracking logic, expense report generation), integration requirements (corporate expense systems, accounting software, project management tools).

**What they need:** Brand assets (logos, colors with hex codes, typography), UI specs (dual interface considerations—personal reimbursement users see different dashboard than corporate users, project tagging UX must be fast/effortless, alert wording for financial warnings), UX considerations (**how present cash flow warnings without panic**, **how present budget warnings without feeling punitive**, project categorization must be frictionless).

**How to work together:** Regular check-ins, explain rationale especially around employee protection features, be clear about which features serve which use case, share work in progress, discuss technical feasibility of real-time alerts, document decisions about dual-mode functionality.

-----

## Final Reminders

**Not fill-in-the-blank.** Creativity in: how you visually represent employee empowerment vs. corporate bureaucracy, how you balance dual use cases without confusion, how you show diverse industries (office workers + field service), how you make expense tracking feel like relief not burden.

**Avoid business tool clichés.** No stuffy corporate imagery, no “smiling person at laptop with expense spreadsheet” stock photos, no boring blue/gray color schemes. Want: employee-first perspective, real work environments (both office and field), visual metaphors for speed/efficiency/protection, **dignity for people doing real work**.

**Cash flow protection is emotional, not just practical.** For personal reimbursement users, fronting thousands of dollars creates real stress—anxiety, embarrassment, financial strain. Design must acknowledge this emotional weight while providing relief. Tone should be empathetic advocate, not corporate authority.

**Project tracking is the differentiator.** Every other tool tracks expenses. PocketBack tracks expenses BY PROJECT. This prevents lost billable expenses, enables accurate client billing, protects employee careers. This is the unique value prop—emphasize it.

**Dual use case must be clear.** System serves two different employee situations—make this clear without being confusing. One brand, two modes, unified by “protecting employees who manage business expenses.”

**Speed is respect.** Employees are busy. Every design decision should ask: does this save them time? Manual entry is disrespectful of their time. Automatic categorization is respectful. Hours-long expense reports are disrespectful. One-click reports are respectful.

**Every decision needs rationale.** “I chose _______ because _______” rooted in: employee financial protection, time savings, project billing accuracy, career protection, dual use case clarity, industry-specific needs.

**Portfolio-worthy work.** Demonstrates: B2B2E business model understanding, dual user persona design, financial services sensitivity, complex workflow simplification, employee advocacy positioning. Do work you’re proud to show.

**Keep asking:** Does this protect employees financially? Does this save them significant time? Does this prevent lost billable expenses? Would this work equally well for office worker and field service tech? Does dual use case create confusion or clarity? Does this feel like it’s on the employee’s side? Would someone switch from their current system to this?
