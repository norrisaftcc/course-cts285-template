# CREATIVE BRIEF: TRUSTY PROJECT EXPENSE TRACKER

-----

# PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

## Project Overview

Create a complete brand identity and product system for **Trusty**—a project-based expense tracking platform serving TWO distinct markets: (A) professional contractors tracking costs across multiple client jobs for profitability, OR (B) homeowners managing major renovation projects to stay within budget.

**Your Assignment:** Choose ONE target audience (contractors OR homeowners) and create a brand that helps them track material costs by project, organize receipts, monitor budgets in real-time, and make informed financial decisions—whether protecting business profit margins or protecting personal renovation budgets.

**CRITICAL:** You must choose which audience to design for. The platform serves both, but brand personality, messaging, visual identity, and deliverables will differ significantly based on your choice.

-----

## Target Audience: Choose Your Focus

### OPTION A: Professional Contractors (B2B Focus)

**Demographics:** Ages 25-60 | Contractors, construction workers, tradespeople (general contractors, electricians, plumbers, framers, roofers, HVAC, landscaping, remodeling) | Income $45K-$95K | Solo operators or small crew leads (2-10 people)

**Pain Points:** “I finished the job but somehow lost money” | “I can’t prove to the client what materials actually cost” | “I’m buying materials from 3 different suppliers and losing track” | “I bid $8,500 for this bathroom, spent $9,200, ate the difference” | “I have no idea which jobs are profitable and which aren’t” | “Receipts in my truck, my toolbox, my wallet—everywhere”

**Current Behavior:** Shoebox of receipts (if they keep them at all) | Estimating costs from memory weeks later | Realizing at tax time they lost money on multiple jobs | Underpricing bids because don’t know actual costs | Can’t prove material costs when clients dispute bills | Eating costs to maintain client relationships

**Use Case:** Tracking material costs across multiple simultaneous client jobs to protect profit margins, prove costs to clients, improve future bidding accuracy

-----

### OPTION B: Homeowners Managing Renovations (B2C Focus)

**Demographics:** Ages 30-65 | Homeowners undertaking major renovation projects (kitchen, bathroom, addition, whole-house remodel) | Household income $75K-$150K | Often using home improvement financing (Home Depot card, Lowe’s card, HELOC, renovation loan)

**Pain Points:** “We’re three months in and have no idea what we’ve actually spent” | “Are we going over budget? We don’t know until it’s too late” | “My spouse and I keep buying stuff without telling each other” | “We have $40K loan but don’t know how much is left” | “Receipts everywhere—how will we return anything or file warranty claims?” | “The contractor says we owe more but we don’t know if that’s right”

**Current Behavior:** Rough budget in head or on napkin | Both spouses buying materials independently | Panic when credit card bill arrives | Spreadsheet abandoned after first month | Receipts in multiple places (car, kitchen drawer, already thrown away) | Realizing they’re $15K over budget when it’s too late to change anything

**Use Case:** Tracking all renovation costs for ONE big project to stay within budget/loan limit, maintain spouse transparency, organize receipts, make trade-off decisions

-----

## Universal Truth: Both Audiences Need Project-Based Expense Tracking

Whether tracking multiple client jobs OR tracking one home renovation project, the core need is the same: **know what you’re spending, organize by project area, stay within budget, keep receipts accessible.**

The difference is context, stakes, and brand personality:

- Contractors = business survival, client relationships, profitability
- Homeowners = family finances, marriage harmony, dream home anxiety

**Students: Choose which audience resonates more with you and design for them.**

## Meet the Founder: Carmen Silva

Carmen grew up watching her dad run a small plumbing business. He was a great plumber—terrible at business. Worked 60-hour weeks but was always broke. She saw him eat costs on jobs rather than argue with clients. Saw him underestimate material costs and lose money on every third job. When he retired, he’d been working 30 years and had almost nothing to show for it.

Carmen became an electrician, then general contractor. Determined not to repeat his mistakes. She tracked every material purchase meticulously in a ledger notebook—job name, supplier, cost, date. Knew exactly what every job cost her, what her profit margin was, whether she was pricing bids correctly. It worked. She was profitable. She could prove costs to clients who questioned bills.

Then at 34, she and her wife decided to renovate their 1950s bungalow—gut the kitchen, remodel both bathrooms, refinish floors. Suddenly Carmen was on the OTHER side. She wasn’t the contractor, she was the client. They had a $45,000 budget (HELOC loan). She thought tracking would be easy—she did this professionally!

It was chaos. Her wife bought tile. Carmen bought fixtures. Contractor bought lumber. Plumber bought pipes. Separate trips to Home Depot, Lowe’s, local suppliers. Receipts everywhere. Three months in, Carmen sat down to tally everything. They’d spent $38,000 and the kitchen wasn’t even done. They were on track to go $20,000 over budget. Panic.

She pulled out her contractor ledger method—started tracking everything by room (kitchen, bathroom 1, bathroom 2, floors). Organized all receipts. Saw exactly where money was going. Realized they could save $3,000 by choosing different tile. Made trade-offs. Finished the project $2,000 under budget.

**Her realization:** The same tracking system that saved her business could save homeowners’ renovation budgets. Contractors need it for profitability. Homeowners need it for sanity. Both need to track expenses by project and know where they stand in real-time.

**Her philosophy:** “Whether it’s your business or your home, you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Every project deserves a trusty system for tracking what you’re spending.”

**The result:** Trusty—project-based expense tracking via card, physical receipt organizer by project area, job tracking booklet, and mobile app with real-time budget alerts. Works for contractors tracking multiple jobs AND homeowners tracking one big renovation.

-----

## Brand Positioning & Key Messages

**Positioning (Adapt to Your Chosen Audience):**

**For Contractors:** For professional contractors (ages 25-60) who lose money on jobs because they can’t accurately track material costs across multiple projects, Trusty is a project expense tracking system that automatically captures every material purchase via card, organizes receipts by job, calculates actual costs vs. bid, and shows profit margins in real-time. Unlike generic expense apps or handwritten ledgers, Trusty is built specifically for contractors who need to protect profitability, prove costs to clients, and improve bid accuracy based on real data.

**For Homeowners:** For homeowners (ages 30-65) managing major renovation projects who feel anxious about going over budget and overwhelmed by scattered receipts, Trusty is a renovation expense tracking system that captures every purchase via card, organizes costs by project area (kitchen, bathrooms, etc.), provides real-time budget alerts, and keeps all receipts accessible. Unlike spreadsheets or hoping you remember what you spent, Trusty gives couples complete transparency into renovation spending so they can make informed trade-off decisions and finish projects on budget.

**Brand Promise:** “Track every project. Trust every number.”

**Key Messages (Adapt to Your Audience):**

**For Contractors:**

1. Know if you made money—before the job ends, not months later
1. Prove material costs to clients—organized receipts by job, every time
1. Bid smarter next time—see actual costs vs. estimates on past jobs
1. Stop losing money on “small” overruns that add up to thousands annually
1. As reliable as your trusty tools—simple, durable, always works

**For Homeowners:**

1. Stay within budget—see exactly what you’ve spent vs. what’s left in real-time
1. No more renovation budget surprises—know where you stand before it’s too late
1. Couple transparency—both see every purchase, make decisions together
1. Organize receipts by room—easy returns, warranty claims, tax deductions
1. Make confident trade-offs—if you spend more here, you know what’s left there

## Why This Works When Others Don’t

**Problem:** “I don’t know if this job made me money or lost me money” (Contractors) → **Solution:** Automatic tracking by job with profit margin calculation

**Problem:** “We have no idea if we’re staying within our renovation budget” (Homeowners) → **Solution:** Real-time budget tracking with alerts before you overspend

**Problem:** “Receipts are scattered across my truck, wallet, and toolbox” (Contractors) → **Solution:** Physical organizer by job + digital backup

**Problem:** “My spouse and I keep buying stuff without telling each other” (Homeowners) → **Solution:** Shared app access, both see all purchases instantly

**Problem:** “I can’t prove to the client what materials actually cost” (Contractors) → **Solution:** Organized receipts by job, digital and physical documentation

**Problem:** “We’re three months into renovation and just realized we’re $10K over budget” (Homeowners) → **Solution:** Real-time alerts catch budget issues before they become catastrophic

**Problem:** “I spend hours tracking expenses in a ledger every week” (Contractors) → **Solution:** Automatic capture via card, minimal manual entry

**Problem:** “I started a spreadsheet but abandoned it after two weeks” (Homeowners) → **Solution:** Automatic tracking, no manual data entry required

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

## User Stories (Choose scenarios matching your target audience)

### Contractor-Focused Stories:

**DeShawn, 38, General Contractor:** Runs small renovation company, 4-person crew, makes $78K. Does 3-5 jobs simultaneously (kitchens, bathrooms, decks, additions). Keeping materials straight is nightmare—bought tile for Johnson job, accidentally installed at Martinez job, had to eat the cost. Last year realized he lost money on 40% of his jobs because underestimated material costs. Had spreadsheet for tracking but too busy to update. Jobs that he thought made $2,000 profit actually lost $400. Almost went under. **How Trusty helps:** Every material purchase tagged to correct job at point of purchase | Can see in real-time which jobs are on budget vs. bleeding money | Physical receipts organized by job—can prove costs to clients | Historical data helps him bid more accurately | Profit margin visibility shows him which job types are actually profitable. **Design takeaway:** Speak to working contractors who can’t spend hours on bookkeeping—emphasize speed, durability, practical utility. Show real job sites, dirty hands, truck storage. Blue-collar authentic without stereotyping. Must feel trustworthy and reliable like their tools.

**Rosa, 51, Electrician:** Licensed electrician, solo operator, makes $71K. Does residential and commercial work—new construction, renovations, service calls. Buys materials from electrical supply houses, Home Depot, specialty suppliers. Tried keeping receipts but they fade, get lost in truck, covered in dirt. Tax time is nightmare—can’t document what she spent. One client disputed her bill, said materials cost too much. She couldn’t prove actual costs, ate $1,200 to keep the relationship. Now keeps meticulous records in Trusty—every wire spool, every fixture, every box, tagged to job. **How Trusty helps:** Digital receipt capture (faded paper doesn’t matter) | Organized by job—can pull up any past job instantly | Tax time: exports all business expenses | Client disputes: can show exactly what was spent | Weather-proof organizer withstands job site conditions. **Design takeaway:** Speak to trades beyond general contractors—electricians, plumbers, HVAC. Emphasize professional credibility, client trust, tax documentation. Show respect for skilled trades. Can’t feel corporate or condescending.

### Homeowner-Focused Stories:

**Jen & Marcus, 34 & 36, Homeowners:** Bought 1970s split-level, gutting kitchen and both bathrooms, $52K budget (HELOC). Both work full-time, have two kids. Jen buys tile at lunch. Marcus stops at Home Depot after work. Contractor buying lumber. Plumber ordering fixtures. Three months in, Jen tried to total everything—receipts in her car, Marcus’s truck, kitchen drawer, some already thrown out. Best guess: $41K spent. Still need appliances ($8K), countertops ($6K), flooring ($4K). They’re going to be $7K over budget and kitchen isn’t done. Panic. Argument. Marcus blamed Jen for “expensive tile.” Jen blamed Marcus for “too many Home Depot trips.” **How Trusty helps:** Both have Trusty cards—see every purchase in real-time | No more surprise spending | “Kitchen: $28K spent of $30K budget” alerts them before over | Make trade-offs: chose less expensive flooring to save $2K | Finished $1,500 under budget | Marriage survived renovation. **Design takeaway:** Speak to couples managing major life project together—emphasize transparency, partnership, reducing relationship stress. Show both partners engaged. Can’t feel condescending to non-professionals. Homeowners are smart, just not contractors.

**Tom, 58, Homeowner:** Retired teacher, renovating lake cabin himself (DIY project). $28K budget (savings). Doing most work himself, hiring out plumbing and electrical. Buying materials as he goes—lumber, drywall, tile, fixtures, tools. Started spreadsheet to track spending. Abandoned it week 3 (too busy actually working). Six months in, realized he had no idea what he’d spent. Guessed $24K? Turns out $31K. Blown budget by $3K and cabin still needs deck, dock repairs. Had to take money from emergency fund. Wished he’d tracked from day one. **How Trusty helps:** Automatic tracking even for DIY—every Home Depot run documented | Budget alerts would’ve caught overspending on materials early | Could’ve made different choices (cheaper flooring, used fixture instead of new) | Physical organizer keeps receipts for warranty claims when stuff breaks | Next project (kitchen at home) will use Trusty from start. **Design takeaway:** Speak to DIY homeowners doing work themselves—respect their skills and initiative. Emphasize budget protection for people working with fixed savings. Show pride in DIY work. Can’t feel like it’s only for people hiring contractors.

## What Motivates Purchase

**Trigger Events:**

**For Contractors:** Realized they lost money on a job | Client disputed bill, couldn’t prove costs | Tax time chaos with no organized records | Underbid a job because didn’t know actual costs | Competitor using better tracking and undercutting prices | Want to grow business but finances are chaotic

**For Homeowners:** Starting major renovation project | Got approved for home improvement loan/HELOC | Heard horror stories about budget overruns | Spouse insisted on transparency | Previous renovation went way over budget | Want to DIY but need to stay organized

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:**

**For Both:** Spreadsheets (manual entry, easy to abandon, time-consuming) | Shoeboxes of receipts (disorganized, receipts fade/get lost, can’t find anything) | Memory (“I think I spent around…”) | Generic expense apps (not built for project-based tracking, no physical receipt organization)

**For Contractors:** Handwritten ledgers (time-consuming, can’t generate reports, hard to analyze profitability trends) | Accounting software (too complex, designed for accountants not contractors, expensive) | Banking apps (show transactions but don’t categorize by job)

**For Homeowners:** “Winging it” (no system, hope for the best, get surprised by overspending) | One partner tracking, other not (lack of transparency causes conflict) | Home improvement store apps (track purchases at ONE store but they buy from multiple places)

-----

## Research Guidance: No Handed Answers

**Audience Research:**

**For Contractors:** Reddit (r/Construction, r/Contractor, r/electricians, r/smallbusiness), trade forums, LinkedIn groups (contractors, tradespeople), YouTube (contractor channels). Find: How do contractors talk about profitability? Common mistakes that lose money? Pain points with tracking? Bidding challenges? Client dispute stories?

**For Homeowners:** Reddit (r/HomeImprovement, r/Renovations, r/DIY), Houzz forums, Pinterest (renovation planning), Facebook groups (home renovation, DIY). Find: Budget anxiety language? Couples’ financial conflicts during renovations? Stories of going over budget? Organization challenges? Decision-making struggles?

**Competitive Research:** Contractor apps (Jobber, Buildertrend, CoConstruct), expense tracking (QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Mint), home improvement store apps (Home Depot, Lowe’s), renovation planning apps (Houzz, Sweeten). Find: Visual territory—professional/corporate OR consumer-friendly? **Who does project-based tracking well? Who makes budget monitoring stress-free? Who serves your chosen audience authentically?**

**Visual Research:** Dribbble/Behance (construction tech, home improvement apps, project management), Pinterest (tool aesthetics, home renovation planning), actual retail (Pro Desk displays, home improvement aisles). Find: **What visual language speaks to contractors—rugged, reliable, no-BS? OR What speaks to homeowners—aspirational but practical, organized, calming?** What colors work for your audience?

**Market Research:** Statistics for your chosen audience: contractor profit margins and common losses, material cost tracking practices OR homeowner renovation budgets and typical overruns, home improvement financing, DIY vs. contractor hiring rates. Sources: Construction industry reports, NAHB, home improvement retailer data, renovation surveys.

## Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need:** Card technical specs (contractor business account vs. homeowner personal account), app architecture (**how project tagging works instantly**, budget tracking algorithms, **contractor profit calculation OR homeowner budget monitoring**, receipt OCR), integration requirements (accounting software for contractors OR home improvement store accounts for homeowners).

**What they need:** Brand assets (logos, colors, typography), UI specs (**interface differs significantly by audience**—contractor dashboard vs. homeowner dashboard, terminology changes, contractor features vs. couple features), UX considerations (**how make project tagging effortless on job site with dirty hands OR at store checkout with screaming kids**, budget alert wording for your audience).

**How to work together:** Regular check-ins, be very clear which audience you’re designing for, explain rationale for audience-specific features, share work in progress, discuss feasibility of dual-market platform with different interfaces, document decisions.

-----

## Final Reminders

**Choose your audience and commit.** Don’t try to design for both—pick contractors OR homeowners and make every decision for them. Brand personality, messaging, visuals, deliverables all differ dramatically.

**Avoid stereotypes.** If choosing contractors: blue-collar doesn’t mean unsophisticated, show respect for skilled work, don’t condescend. If choosing homeowners: DIY doesn’t mean clueless, renovation stress is real and valid, don’t make them feel inadequate.

**“Trusty” must feel trusty.** Reliable, durable, dependable, always works. Like their favorite hammer or their best friend. Not flashy, just solid. This brand promise must come through in every touchpoint.

**Project-based tracking is the differentiator.** Every other tool tracks expenses. Trusty tracks expenses BY PROJECT. For contractors: protects profitability. For homeowners: prevents budget disasters. This is the unique value—emphasize it.

**Physical + digital integration matters.** Not just an app. Physical receipt organizer and job booklet matter. Show how physical and digital work together. This isn’t just another fintech app—it’s a complete system.

**Respect the work.** Whether contractor building decks or homeowner renovating their kitchen, this is skilled, meaningful work. Design should honor that effort and show respect for the financial stakes involved.

**Every decision needs rationale.** “I chose _______ because _______” rooted in: chosen audience needs, project tracking emphasis, budget protection, trustworthiness, practical utility, respect for skilled work.

**Portfolio-worthy work.** Demonstrates: audience choice and commitment, dual-market understanding, industry-specific design, physical + digital system thinking, authentic voice for chosen audience. Do work you’re proud to show.

**Keep asking:** Does this feel authentic to contractors OR homeowners (whichever you chose)? Does “trusty” come through—reliable, dependable, always there? Does project-based tracking get emphasized? Would your chosen audience actually use this? Does physical + digital integration make sense? Does this respect the work and the workers? Can I defend every decision based on my chosen audience?
