# CREATIVE BRIEF: BAG COLLEGE FINANCE CARD

# PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

## Project Overview

Create a complete brand identity and product system for **Bag**—a college financial management platform that helps university students track their complete financial picture (financial aid, work income, gig income, parent contributions, all expenses) with semester-based budgeting designed for the realities of college life.

**Your Assignment:** Create a brand that empowers college students (18-22) to manage money independently for the first time, make financial aid last the full semester, build healthy financial habits, and navigate the irregular income/expense patterns of university life—while giving parents visibility and peace of mind without controlling every purchase.

## Target Audience: University Students Finding Financial Independence

**Primary User: College Students (18-22)**

**Demographics:** Ages 18-22 | Traditional 4-year university students | Living on/near campus (dorms, apartments) | Away from home, first taste of real independence | Mix of financial backgrounds (some have generous parents, some are entirely aid-dependent, most are somewhere in between)

**Financial Reality:**

- **Income sources:** Financial aid disbursements (Pell Grants, student loans, VA benefits) + part-time jobs/work-study + gig work (DoorDash, tutoring, freelance) + parent contributions + scholarships + side hustles
- **Income is irregular:** Aid comes in lump sums at semester start, work-study hours vary week to week, gig income unpredictable, parents send money sporadically
- **Expenses are irregular:** Huge textbook costs at semester start, then relatively stable food/social spending, then finals week chaos

**Pain Points:** “I got my $6,000 aid disbursement and blew through $3,000 in three weeks” | “I can’t afford textbooks now even though I got financial aid for that” | “I don’t know if I can afford to go out—how much money do I actually have?” | “My parents keep asking where my money went and I have no idea” | “I thought I had enough to last the semester but I’m broke by week 10” | “I’m working 15 hours/week but don’t know where that money goes” | “My aid has restrictions but I don’t know what I can buy with it”

**Current Behavior:** Gets aid disbursement, feels rich temporarily, spends freely | No semester-based budget (treats it like monthly income but it has to last 16 weeks) | Loses track of multiple income sources | Can’t distinguish between “school money” and “personal money” | Panics mid-semester when money runs out | Takes out MORE loans to cover poor spending choices | Parents frustrated, students defensive

**Secondary User: Parents (45-60)**
Want their college kids to learn financial responsibility | Worried about overspending or poor choices | Often funding part of college costs | Want visibility without being controlling | Remember their own college financial mistakes | Want to help without enabling | Seeking balance between safety net and independence

## Meet the Founder: Patricia Mendez

Patricia has worked in university financial aid offices for 18 years. Every single semester, she sees the same pattern repeat hundreds of times:

Week 1: Students receive aid disbursement. Excited. Finally have money.
Week 2-3: Spending spree. New laptop (even though old one works fine). Going out constantly. Treating friends. Upgrading everything.
Week 6-8: Starting to worry. Money going faster than expected.
Week 10-12: Panic. Students lining up at financial aid office asking why they’re broke.

Patricia would explain: “You received $6,500 in aid. It has to last 16 weeks. You spent $4,000 in the first month.” Students would look shocked. “I didn’t realize I had to make it last that long.”

She tried everything: Financial literacy workshops (3% attendance). Budgeting handouts (thrown away). One-on-one counseling (students nodded, then did the same thing). The system was broken. Students weren’t irresponsible—they’d just never been taught to manage irregular, lump-sum income across a semester.

Then her daughter Maya went to college. Maya was smart, responsible, had watched Patricia work in financial aid for years. Patricia warned her about the disbursement trap. Maya promised she’d be careful.

Week 7 of fall semester: Patricia got a call. Maya, crying. “Mom, I don’t have money for groceries.” Patricia’s heart sank. “What happened to your aid?” Maya had received $7,200. Bought textbooks ($800). Laptop upgrade ($1,400). Going out with new friends. Coffee runs. Late-night food orders. Door Dash constantly. She’d blown through $5,000 in six weeks without realizing it.

Patricia drove three hours to campus with groceries. Sat down with Maya. Helped her audit every expense. The problem was clear: Maya didn’t have a system. The money was abstract. Multiple income sources (aid + work-study + parents sending money) made tracking impossible. Monthly budgeting apps didn’t work for 16-week semester cycles.

**Patricia’s realization:** Students don’t need lectures. They need a system designed for how college finances actually work—irregular income, semester-based spending, multiple funding sources, campus-specific restrictions, first-time independence. They need real-time feedback, not month-end regret.

**Her philosophy:** “Financial aid isn’t ‘free money’ to blow in a month. It’s a semester-long resource that has to be strategically managed. Students aren’t irresponsible—they’re just navigating a financial situation adults never taught them how to handle.”

**The result:** Bag—tracks ALL income sources (aid, work, gigs, parents), budgets by semester not month, paces aid spending across 16 weeks, provides real-time alerts, gives parents visibility without control, teaches financial independence through guardrails not restrictions. Helps students secure their bag—literally and financially.

## Brand Positioning & Key Messages

**Positioning:** For university students (18-22) navigating financial independence for the first time who manage irregular income from multiple sources (financial aid, part-time work, gig economy, parent contributions) and need to make money last across semester-based academic calendars, Bag is a college financial management system that tracks complete income and spending, paces financial aid disbursements across 16-week semesters, provides real-time budget alerts tuned to college life, and teaches financial responsibility through smart guardrails not parental control. Unlike generic budgeting apps designed for monthly paychecks or campus cards that only work on campus, Bag understands the complete, messy, irregular financial reality of university life and helps students build healthy money habits while maintaining independence.

**Brand Promise:** “Secure your bag. Own your independence.”

**Key Messages:**

1. Track your complete financial picture—aid, work, gigs, parents, everything in one place
1. Make your aid last the semester—pace spending across 16 weeks, not blow it in 3
1. Real-time reality checks—know if you can actually afford that before you buy it
1. Independence with guardrails—learn financial responsibility without parental micromanagement
1. Built for college life—semester budgets, textbook planning, irregular income, campus spending

# PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

## What Is Bag?

College financial management system combining proprietary payment card (links to financial aid account + personal checking + work income deposits), physical budget planner for semester-based planning, savings challenge cards for gamified goals, and mobile app = **complete income tracking** from all sources + **semester-based budgeting** (not monthly) + **financial aid pacing alerts** + **real-time spending decisions** + **parent visibility without control** + **teaching financial independence**.

Think: Every dollar tracked—whether from aid disbursement, work-study paycheck, DoorDash earnings, or parents—with budgeting that understands you need to make $6K last 16 weeks not 4, alerts that catch you before financial disaster, and independence to make your own choices within smart boundaries.

## How Physical + Digital Work Together

**Semester Start:** Receive aid (bank) → Set up budget (app) → Fill planner (physical writing) → Set savings goals (challenge cards) → Link accounts (digital)

**Weekly Check-In:** Review spending (app data) → Update planner (physical reflection) → Adjust challenge progress (physical tracking) → Plan next week based on pace

**Real-Time Living:** Use card (physical) → Instant alert (digital feedback) → Learn if aligned with goals (teaching moment)

**Semester End:** App generates report (digital analysis) → Planner shows journey (reflection) → Challenge cards show achievements (celebration) → Learn for next semester

-----

## Why This Works When Others Don’t

“I blew through aid in 4 weeks” → Semester budgeting with aid pacing catches this before disaster | “No idea how much I have between aid/work/parents” → Tracks all sources in one place | “Monthly apps don’t work for irregular income” → Semester-based accounts for lump sums and irregular deposits | “Parents want to control my spending” → Visibility without control, they see you’re learning | “I thought I was responsible but still broke” → Real-time alerts teach what responsible looks like | “Campus cards only work on campus” → One card, all spending, complete tracking | “Generic advice doesn’t understand college” → Built for semester schedules, textbook costs, irregular income, first independence

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

## User Stories (Composite Characters)

**Jasmine, 19, Sophomore:** State university, commutes, works retail 20 hrs/week, $4,200 Pell + $2,500 loan/semester, parents send $200/month. First semester spent entire aid in 5 weeks, couldn’t afford textbooks by midterms, almost failed Chem. Parents disappointed. Felt ashamed. Second semester used Bag—linked all income, app alerted week 3 she was burning through aid, adjusted spending, made aid last, built $300 emergency fund from work. Felt capable and independent. **How Bag helps:** Complete income tracking | Semester pacing catches overspending early | Textbook budget planning | Emergency fund building | Real-time learning | Parents see responsibility without micromanaging. **Design takeaway:** Speak to students balancing work and school, multiple income sources, figuring out independence. Emphasize empowerment not shame, learning by doing, confidence building. Show diversity of college experiences. Gen Z authentic—supportive peer not authority.

**Marcus, 20, Junior:** Large public university, off-campus with roommates, $6,800 aid/semester, DoorDash weekends ($400-600/month varies), parents send $150/month. First two years took max loans, spent freely, now $38K debt and terrified. Trying to be responsible but overwhelmed. Five different apps, can’t see complete picture. Bag showed him ALL income and expenses in one place. Discovered spending $380/month on food delivery. Shocked. Shifted to groceries, cut delivery to twice monthly, saved $280/month, built $800 emergency fund. Feels like getting financial life together. **How Bag helps:** Consolidates chaos into clear picture | Spending analysis shows money drains | Gig income tracking | Semester view shows trajectory | Alerts stop impulse spending | Visible progress motivating. **Design takeaway:** Speak to students stressed about debt, juggling gigs, overwhelmed. Emphasize clarity, simplification, achievable progress. Financial responsibility is learnable, mistakes fixable. Tone: encouraging coach not disappointed parent.

**Aisha & Taylor, 18 & 19, Freshman Roommates:** Private university, both first-gen, both ~$8K aid/semester. Neither has financially literate parents. First semester disaster—Aisha spent $2,400 in three weeks on dorm decor/clothes/going out. Taylor more cautious but no framework, ran out week 11. Both took additional loans. Families stressed. Second semester financial aid office recommended Bag. Both set up accounts, transparency between them helped—kept each other accountable. “Sure you want DoorDash? You’re at 70% food budget.” Made spending collaborative learning not competitive. Both finished with aid intact, savings, skills. **How Bag helps:** First-gen students get guidance they lack at home | Peer accountability (with consent) | Pacing prevents early overspending | Alerts as financial mentor | Challenge cards make goals tangible | Independence without being alone. **Design takeaway:** Speak to first-gen students, no safety nets, learning from scratch. Emphasize community, peer learning, non-judgmental teaching. Show diversity, inclusion, literacy for everyone regardless of background. Avoid assumptions. Tone: patient teacher, supportive community, “figuring this out together.”

**Kevin, 21, Senior (+ mom Linda, 54):** Flagship state, $5,500 loans/semester, campus IT 15 hrs/week, freelance web design. Kevin thinks he’s good with money (budget spreadsheet). Mom Linda constantly worries, sees charges on her credit card (he’s authorized user), panics. Kevin feels smothered, Linda helpless. Tension over money. Linda found Bag, suggested it. Kevin rolled eyes but agreed. Game-changer: Parent portal shows Linda he’s on track, building savings, learning. She stopped worried texts. Kevin appreciates transparency proving capability. Relationship improved. Kevin now asks advice (not defensive) because she’s not micromanaging. **How Bag helps:** Portal gives visibility without control | Kevin proves responsibility with data | Linda’s anxiety reduced | Communication improved | Kevin maintains autonomy, parents have peace | Trust through transparency. **Design takeaway:** Address parent/student dynamic—students want independence, parents want reassurance. Show transparency builds trust better than control. Appeal to both (Gen Z autonomy + parent peace). Visuals: healthy parent/adult child relationship, mutual respect. Tone: mature, acknowledging both perspectives, facilitating healthy independence.

## Collaboration with Programming Students

**What you need:** Card specs (links multiple accounts, switching between them), app architecture (**semester budgeting algorithms**, **16-week aid pacing**, **irregular income tracking**, parent portal separate access, alert triggers), campus integration (bookstore restrictions if applicable).

**What they need:** Brand assets (Gen Z appropriate), UI specs (**student vs. parent interface**, Gen Z patterns, gamification, social with privacy), UX considerations (**helpful alerts not nagging**, **present overspending without shame**, notification frequency teaches without annoying, student-appropriate onboarding).

**How to work together:** Regular check-ins, test with actual students, explain Gen Z expectations, share WIP, open to “that’s not how students talk/behave” feedback, document dual audience decisions.

-----

## Final Reminders

**Gen Z authentic, not “fellow kids.”** Use actual slang (“secure the bag”), not what brands think. Test with real students. Cringe destroys credibility.

**Dual audience, dual messaging.** Students want independence. Parents want peace of mind. Don’t serve both with same message—have student-facing and parent-facing content.

**Learning through doing, not lectures.** Real-time alerts are teaching moments. “You’re about to spend $X” beats “here’s how to budget” lecture. Learning happens in decision moment.

**Semester-based is differentiator.** Every other app uses monthly. College runs on semesters. Aid comes in lumps. Fundamentally different. Emphasize this unique understanding.

**Aid pacing prevents disaster.** Students don’t realize $6K has to last 16 weeks. Aid pacing alerts prevent crisis that causes dropout. Emphasize impact.

**Complete income picture matters.** Chaotic income—aid + work + gigs + parents. Tracking one source is useless. Bag tracks everything. Holistic view essential for real literacy.

**Judgment-free learning.** Students are learning. Mistakes happen. Tone: supportive peer/helpful teacher, never disappointed parent or judgmental authority.

**Physical + digital serves learning.** Gen Z grew up digital but physical (planner, cards) provides tangible progress and different modality. Don’t dismiss as “outdated.”

**Independence is goal.** Parents want safety net, students want autonomy. Bag facilitates healthy independence—students prove responsibility through data, earn trust, maintain autonomy.

**Every decision needs rationale.** “I chose _______ because _______” rooted in: Gen Z communication, college financial realities, semester budgets, first-time independence, dual audience, literacy pedagogy, preventing loan disaster.

**Portfolio-worthy work.** Demonstrates: Gen Z marketing authenticity, dual audience strategy, educational product, literacy tool, understanding college life, complex system design. Do work you’re proud to show.

**Keep asking:** Gen Z authentic or trying too hard? Speaks to actual college reality (not idealized)? Semester budgeting emphasized? Would students actually use or feel like imposed obligation? Parent feature enhance or undermine independence? Would this prevent aid disbursement disaster? “Secure your bag” comes through—empowerment, capability, independence? Can I defend every decision based on real college life?
