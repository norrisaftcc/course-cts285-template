## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### The Assignment

Students will develop a complete brand system and campaign for MoodSync™, a biometric emotional regulation platform that reframes feelings as measurable productivity inputs. The challenge is to design a brand that feels reassuring, premium, and inevitable—while quietly normalizing emotional surveillance as “support.”

### Target Audience

**Demographics:**
Ages 24–45 | Bachelor’s degree or higher | Corporate, tech, finance, healthcare, education | $55K–$120K | Urban/suburban | Hybrid or in-office

**Pain Points:**
Emotional exhaustion during work hours | Pressure to appear calm and motivated | Vague performance feedback | Fear of being seen as “difficult” | Burnout reframed as personal failure

**Current Behavior:**
Self-monitoring tone and expressions | Using wellness apps inconsistently | Masking frustration | Overusing productivity tools | Internalizing feedback

**What They Want:**
Clear expectations | Objective feedback | Job security | Emotional validation without vulnerability | To be seen as “high potential”

### Company Background

MoodSync™ was founded 7 years ago by a former HR analytics director who was repeatedly told she was “emotionally intense” in performance reviews. After tracking her sleep, steps, and output with no improvement in feedback, she realized the missing metric was affect. Pilot programs showed managers responded better to dashboards than conversations. MoodSync™ was built to remove ambiguity from emotion.
**Founder philosophy:** “What gets measured gets managed—especially you.”

### Brand Positioning

**Key Messages:**

* Feelings, clarified
* Alignment is care
* Data never misunderstands
* Calm is collaborative
* Optimization is empathy

**Brand Personality:**
Reassuring | Authoritative | Sanitized | Optimistic

**Visual Direction:**
Soft gradients | Medical minimalism | Corporate futurism | Neutral warmth

**What to Avoid:**
Chaos | Expressive messiness | Humor | Anything “handmade”

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What MoodSync™ Is

MoodSync™ is a biometric platform combining wearable hardware and AI analytics to monitor emotional states in real time. It translates affective data into a single, readable **Emotional Efficiency Score™** visible to users and management.

### Physical Components

**Mood Ring 2.0:**
NFC-enabled | Skin-contact biometric sensors | Subtle LED efficiency display | Passive data capture | Corporate-approved aesthetic

### Digital Components

**MoodSync™ Dashboard:**
Real-time score tracking | Historical trend analysis | Manager access portal | Slack/Teams integration | Automated alerts

### Core Features

**Emotional Efficiency Score™ (Addresses emotional ambiguity):**
A proprietary composite score derived from heart rate variability, skin temperature, and micro-expression data. Users receive a daily efficiency rating that defines emotional performance standards. Green is aligned. Yellow is cautionary. Red is actionable.

**Calibration Alerts (Addresses performance risk):**
When emotional output drops below benchmark, automated alerts are sent to the user with “re-centering prompts.” Persistent misalignment triggers manager notifications framed as “support opportunities.”

**Manager Visibility Mode (Addresses leadership blind spots):**
Provides managers with anonymized-at-first emotional trend data, escalating to identifiable data when thresholds are crossed. Reduces the need for difficult conversations.

**Optimization Insights:**
Weekly summaries | Comparative team averages | “Growth readiness” indicators

**View Modes:**
Self | Team | Leadership | Compliance

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
Workplaces claim to value authenticity while rewarding emotional conformity. Feedback is subjective, inconsistent, and often gendered or biased. Employees are left guessing what “professional” really means.

**The Emotional Toll:**
Workers suppress emotions, overanalyze interactions, and self-correct constantly. Burnout becomes a personal defect rather than a system issue.

**How MoodSync™ Helps:**

* **Clarity:** Emotions quantified into expectations
* **Safety:** Early alerts prevent reputational damage
* **Alignment:** Teams feel calmer together
* **Efficiency:** Less talk, more data

**Different from Wellness Apps:**
MoodSync™ does not ask users how they feel. It tells them.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Alex — High Potential

**Design takeaway:** Visual language should reward neutrality.

### User Story 3: Jordan — The Risk

**Design takeaway:** Design must normalize correction as care.

### User Story 4: Elena — The Manager

Elena, 38, team lead | Finance | Data-driven | Avoids emotional conversations. MoodSync™ provides objective justification for intervention.

* Would this survive a legal review?
* Does the system feel kind?
