*Read this section first. This is your starting point.*

-----

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Product Name:** Ora  
**Product Category:** Women’s Health & Fertility Tracking System  
**Project Type:** Complete Brand Identity & Campaign Development  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks

This creative brief is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between Graphic Design and Programming students. Programming teams have developed a universal biometric tracking platform. Design teams will each create unique brand identities targeting different market segments.

**Your Assignment:** Develop the complete brand identity for Ora, a medical-grade biometric tracking platform for women’s reproductive health providing continuous data across fertility, pregnancy, PCOS/endometriosis management, and perimenopause.

-----

## TARGET AUDIENCE

**Primary User:** Women ages 25-45 | $50K-$100K income | Actively trying to conceive OR managing PCOS/endometriosis OR currently pregnant OR entering perimenopause

**Key Characteristics:** Frustrated by dismissed symptoms | Wants data-driven health decisions | Tired of inaccurate fertility apps | Medical providers don’t take symptom reports seriously | Seeks objective validation | Tech-comfortable but healthcare-skeptical | Researches health online extensively | Willing to invest in solutions that actually work

**Pain Points:** Fertility apps predict wrong ovulation days for irregular cycles | Doctors dismiss pain (“it’s just stress,” “periods hurt”) | Manual basal body temperature tracking too demanding (wake exact time daily) | Ovulation test strips expensive and unreliable | Symptom diaries ignored by providers | Pregnancy anxiety between appointments | Perimenopause symptoms dismissed as “just aging” | Feel like they’re guessing about their own bodies

**Current Behavior:** Use multiple fertility apps (Flo, Clue, Ovia) - all give different predictions | Buy $30-40/month ovulation test strips | Attempt manual BBT tracking but quit after 2 months (too stressful) | Keep detailed symptom diaries doctors barely read | Google “is this normal?” constantly | Join online communities (Reddit r/tryingforababy, r/PCOS, r/endometriosis, r/Menopause) seeking validation | Advocate fiercely in medical appointments | Want proof symptoms are real

-----

## COMPANY BACKGROUND

**Dr. Sarah Chen**, 46, OB/GYN, practiced 15 years treating the full spectrum of women’s reproductive health. **Jessica Martinez**, 38, was her patient for 6 years managing severe endometriosis. When Jessica tried to conceive, she used every fertility app available—all predicted ovulation on Day 14 based on “average” cycles. Her endometriosis-affected cycles ranged 23-42 days. The predictions were completely wrong. After 13 months of trying, Jessica broke down at an appointment: **“I don’t know when I’m ovulating. I don’t know if my pain is normal or crisis-level. I’m just guessing about everything with my own body.”**

Dr. Chen realized she was asking questions Jessica couldn’t answer objectively: “Are you ovulating? How bad is the pain compared to last month?” In every other area of medicine, objective data drives treatment—blood pressure, heart rate, lab tests. But women’s reproductive health is managed through self-reporting and guessing. **Together they built Ora.** Dr. Chen brought medical expertise about which biometric signals matter (basal body temperature for ovulation, HRV with hormone fluctuations, sleep patterns). Jessica brought patient experience (data that validates pain to dismissive doctors, tracking that works for irregular cycles, comfortable 24/7 wear).

Jessica was the first beta tester. Within 3 months of using Ora’s continuous temperature tracking, she conceived—she ovulated Day 21, not Day 14 like apps predicted. Her endometriosis pain patterns became visible: HRV dropped 40% during pain weeks, sleep fragmented (8-10 wakings/night), activity declined 35%. Dr. Chen used objective biometric data—not subjective pain diary—to adjust treatment.

**Dr. Chen’s philosophy:** *“Women’s bodies are incredibly data-rich—we cycle, we ovulate, our hormones shift. We’ve just never had accessible tools to actually measure what’s happening. Ora gives women the same precision tracking that men get for heart attacks. It’s about time.”*

-----

## BRAND POSITIONING

**For** women ages 25-45 trying to conceive, managing PCOS/endometriosis, navigating pregnancy, or entering perimenopause who need objective data instead of guesswork, **Ora** is a medical-grade biometric tracking platform **that** provides continuous monitoring of basal body temperature, heart rate variability, sleep quality, and vital signs. **Unlike** fitness wearables that added period tracking as an afterthought (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura) or fertility apps relying on population averages (Flo, Clue, Natural Cycles), **Ora** is purpose-built for women’s hormonal health with medical-grade sensors, continuous passive tracking, and healthcare provider integration.

-----

## WHAT IS ORA?

Ora is a **medical-grade biometric monitoring platform** for women’s reproductive health. Core product: **smart ring** with medical-grade sensors tracking basal body temperature, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep quality, and activity 24/7. Data syncs to mobile app providing ovulation confirmation, cycle insights, symptom correlation, and pregnancy monitoring. Healthcare providers access patient data through secure portal with exportable reports.

**Modular ecosystem:** Ring is foundational product for all life stages | Optional **pregnancy belly band** add-on (20 weeks through delivery) for fetal movement tracking, contraction detection, labor progression monitoring

-----

## PHYSICAL COMPONENTS

### Ora Ring (Primary Product)

**Smart Sensor Core:** Lightweight titanium ring (under 0.2 oz, 7.8mm width, 2.7mm thickness) | Sizes 5-10 | Medical-grade sensors: NTC thermistor for BBT (±0.13°F accuracy), PPG optical sensors for HR/HRV, 3-axis accelerometer for activity/sleep | Wears 24/7 any finger | Water-resistant IP68 | 5-7 day battery | Wireless magnetic charging (80 min full charge) | Four finishes: silver titanium, stealth black, rose gold, horizon gold | Hypoallergenic (medical-grade titanium, no nickel)

**Modular Band System:** Sensor core slides into interchangeable decorative bands | **Sport Silicone** ($19): comfortable sleep/exercise, multiple colors | **Metal Finish** ($39): rose gold, silver, gold, gunmetal | **Premium** ($49): crystal accents, textured designs | Allows personalization while maintaining medical-grade sensor

### Ora Belly Band (Ecosystem Add-On)

**When worn:** 20 weeks pregnancy through delivery (~20 weeks of use) | **Price:** $129

**What it tracks:**

- **20-32 weeks:** Fetal movement counting (kicks, rolls, hiccups) | Baseline establishment (learns YOUR baby’s normal patterns) | Movement timing patterns | Maternal vitals from torso
- **32+ weeks:** Continued movement tracking | **Decreased movement alerts** (movement 70% below baseline = immediate alert: “Contact provider immediately - could indicate distress”) | Contraction detection | Maternal vitals
- **Labor & Delivery:** Contraction tracking (frequency, duration, intensity) | Labor progression alerts (5-1-1 rule: contractions 5 min apart, 1+ min duration, 1+ hour = “Active labor detected. Time to go.”) | **Auto-notifications to birthing team** (midwife/OB receives alert with contraction data)

**Why life-saving:** Decreased fetal movement often ONLY warning sign of placental insufficiency, cord compression, fetal distress, stillbirth | Medical standard: “count kicks” daily (lie down, count 10 movements in 2 hours)—but who remembers consistently? | Ora automates continuously, alerts when patterns change

**What’s included:** Soft adjustable fabric band | Washable with removable sensor pod | Grows with pregnancy | Multiple neutral colors | Charging cable | Care instructions

-----

## DIGITAL COMPONENTS

### Mobile App Features

**Fertility Tracking:**

- Basal body temperature continuous measurement | Temperature shift detection confirms ovulation | Fertile window identification (5-6 days before ovulation) | Luteal phase tracking | Anovulatory cycle detection (had period, didn’t ovulate—common PCOS)

**PCOS/Endometriosis Symptom Correlation:**

- User logs pain episodes | App shows correlation with cycle phase, HRV drops, sleep disruption, activity decline | **Objective validation:** “During pain weeks, HRV drops 40%, sleep fragments (8 wakings/night), activity declines 35%” | Exportable reports for doctors

**Pregnancy Monitoring (Ring + Optional Belly Band):**

- Maternal vitals (resting HR, sleep, activity, temperature) | **Fetal movement tracking** (belly band): baseline establishment, daily comparison, decreased movement alerts | **Contraction tracking** (belly band): timing, pattern detection, labor progression | Auto-alerts to birthing team

**Perimenopause:**

- Hot flash detection (skin temp spikes) | Sleep disruption tracking (night wakings, sleep stages) | Cycle irregularity patterns | HRT effectiveness tracking (is hormone therapy working? Data shows it)

### Provider Portal

Healthcare providers access patient data (with permission) through secure portal:

- Pre-appointment review (6-month reports before visits)
- Objective patient data (THIS patient’s normal, not population averages)
- Ovulation confirmation dates (not patient’s guess)
- Pain correlation with biometrics (validates symptoms)
- Medication effectiveness tracking
- Exportable medical-standard PDF reports

-----

## HOW IT WORKS

**Ring measures continuously:** BBT detects ovulation | HRV indicates stress/hormonal shifts | Sleep shows wellness/disruption | Activity identifies pain/energy changes | **Data syncs to smartphone** via Bluetooth | **App analyzes patterns:** compares to population norms AND individual baseline (established first 2-3 cycles) | **Alerts when concerning:** confirmed ovulation, symptom patterns, decreased fetal movement (if pregnant) | **Providers access data:** objective metrics for diagnosis/treatment vs. subjective “I think I’m ovulating”

**System catches invisible changes:** Activity declining 30% over weeks (endo flare) | HRV dropping before symptom onset | Resting HR climbing | Sleep fragmenting | Decreased fetal movement (life-saving early warning)

-----

## WHY THIS WORKS WHEN OTHERS DON’T

**Fertility Apps (Flo, Clue, Ovia):** Predict Day 14 ovulation (population average) | Wrong for irregular cycles | Require daily manual input | No biometric measurement | Give predictions, not confirmations | **Ora:** Measures actual BBT continuously, confirms ovulation AFTER it occurs, learns YOUR patterns

**Manual BBT Tracking:** Wake exact time daily (stressful, disrupts sleep) | Single morning measurement | Easy to forget/mess up | Chart interpretation confusing | **Ora:** Measures every minute all night, uses lowest stable temp, automatic charting, clear confirmation

**Ovulation Test Strips:** Expensive ($30-40/month) | Wasteful | Ambiguous results | Detects LH surge, doesn’t confirm ovulation | Doesn’t work for PCOS | **Ora:** No daily testing, confirms actual ovulation, no waste

**Fitness Wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura):** Period tracking added as afterthought | No basal body temperature (need ±0.13°F accuracy—they don’t have it) | No ovulation confirmation | No provider portal | Generic health, not women’s health specific | **Ora:** Purpose-built with medical-grade BBT sensor, ovulation confirmation, provider integration

**Symptom Diaries:** Subjective (“pain 7/10”) | Doctors dismiss (“sounds rough” but no treatment change) | No objective validation | **Ora:** Biometric data (HRV drops 40%, sleep fragments, activity declines) doctors can’t dismiss

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

*Use this section to understand emotional context and real needs.*

-----

## USER STORIES

### Story 1: Maya, 28, Marketing Manager - TTC with Irregular Cycles

Maya makes $68K, trying to conceive 8 months with irregular cycles (26-38 days). Used Flo, Clue, Natural Cycles—each predicts different fertile windows, none account for variability. Bought ovulation test strips ($40/month) but rarely gets positives. Tried manual BBT for 3 months (wake 6am daily, stressful, forgot sometimes, chart confusing). OB glanced at temps: “Looks like you might be ovulating, keep trying.”

**What she said:** “Three apps tell me three different things. I don’t know if I’m actually ovulating. I’m spending $40/month on strips that don’t work for me. Manual temps made me anxious—if I woke at 6:15 not 6:00, did I ruin the data? I just want to know: am I ovulating, and when?”

**Design takeaway:** Show how Ora removes daily tasks and provides actual ovulation confirmation for irregular cycles. Emphasize “learns YOUR patterns” and “works for any cycle length.”

-----

### Story 2: Tiana, 34, Teacher - Endometriosis Symptom Validation

Tiana makes $52K, has endometriosis 9 years. Seen 4 gynecologists who minimized pain (“periods hurt,” “take ibuprofen”). Keeps detailed symptom diary—pain 1-10, where, what makes worse. Doctors skim diary, say “sounds difficult,” rarely adjust treatment. Exhausted advocating with subjective reports that get dismissed.

**What she said:** “I’ve had doctors tell me I’m exaggerating, ‘just take Advil,’ it’s probably stress. They don’t take my pain diary seriously. I want data showing: during pain weeks, I’m not sleeping, I can barely function, my body is stressed. I want proof this is real so doctors can’t dismiss me.”

**Design takeaway:** Emphasize objective symptom validation. Show how biometric data (HRV drops, sleep disruption, activity decline) proves pain is physiologically real. Position as tool for medical advocacy.

-----

### Story 3: Rachel, 31, First-Time Mom - Pregnancy After Loss (LIFE-SAVING)

Rachel makes $79K, 28 weeks pregnant, had miscarriage 10 weeks two years ago. Lives in constant anxiety between monthly OB appointments. Googles symptoms, calls nurse line frequently, tries to “count kicks” daily but forgets. At 29 weeks started Ora Belly Band. Band established baseline: 12-14 movements per 12 hours, most active 8pm-midnight.

At 31 weeks Tuesday, **Ora alerted: “Fetal movement 70% below baseline past 24 hours. Contact provider immediately. Could indicate distress.”** Rachel noticed baby “quieter” but assumed sleeping more. Called midwife, came in immediately. Non-stress test showed baby in distress—cord compressed. Emergency C-section. Baby boy born healthy 31 weeks. **Midwife: “If you’d waited another day or two, this could have been very different. The belly band data saved your baby’s life.”**

**Design takeaway:** This is Ora’s most powerful story—life-saving technology, not just convenience. Balance emotional weight with hope. Show belly band as critical safety device addressing medical need (stillbirth prevention), not just anxiety management.

-----

### Story 4: Jennifer, 43, HR Director - Perimenopause Validation

Jennifer makes $95K, past year: waking drenched in sweat 3-4x/night, terrible insomnia (wake 2am can’t sleep), brain fog, anxiety, irregular periods (21-45 days). Doctor ran bloodwork: “hormones normal for age, probably stress.” Therapist suggested antidepressants. Doctor dismissed perimenopause: “you’re only 43, that’s early.”

With Ora: data showed skin temp spikes 5-8x/night (hot flashes), sleep fragmented (6-10 wakings, reduced deep sleep), HRV dropping (hormonal stress), anovulatory cycles increasing. Brought 3 months Ora data to doctor showing objective patterns. Doctor prescribed HRT. After 6 weeks: hot flashes reduced 7/night to 2/night, sleep improved (4 wakings vs. 8, deep sleep up 40%), HRV normalizing.

**What Jennifer said:** “For a year I thought I was losing my mind. Doctor said it was stress. I felt gaslit. Ora gave objective data showing: yes, you’re waking 8x/night, yes, your temp is spiking, yes, your body is stressed. My doctor couldn’t dismiss that. I could see HRT working in data before I felt better.”

**Design takeaway:** Position as validation tool for dismissed symptoms. Show empowerment through data—getting doctors to listen and treat effectively.

## WHAT MOTIVATES PURCHASE

**Trigger Events:** TTC 3+ months without success | Diagnosed PCOS/endometriosis/irregular cycles | Frustrated with inaccurate apps | Manual BBT too stressful | Doctor dismissed pain/symptoms | Pregnant and anxious (especially after loss) | Perimenopause symptoms (night sweats, insomnia, brain fog) | Provider recommended

**Emotional Drivers:** Frustration with guessing | Desire for objective data/confirmation | Exhaustion from daily tracking | Want to conceive faster | Need to validate pain to dismissive doctors | Pregnancy anxiety | Feeling gaslit by healthcare | Want proof symptoms real | Empowerment through knowledge

-----

## WHY EXISTING SOLUTIONS FAIL

**Fertility Apps:** Predict Day 14 (wrong for irregular) | Daily manual input | No biometric measurement | Predictions not confirmations | Inaccurate for PCOS/endo/perimenopause

**Manual BBT:** Wake exact time daily (stressful) | Single measurement | Easy to forget | Chart interpretation confusing

**Ovulation Strips:** Expensive | Wasteful | Ambiguous results | Don’t confirm ovulation | Don’t work for PCOS

**Fitness Wearables:** Period tracking afterthought | No BBT | No ovulation confirmation | No provider portal | Generic health not women’s specific

**Symptom Diaries:** Subjective | Doctors dismiss | No objective validation

**Pregnancy Anxiety:** Manual kick counting inconsistent | No baseline | By time movement reduction obvious, baby may be in distress

**Perimenopause Dismissal:** Hot flashes subjective | Sleep complaints dismissed | Symptoms attributed to stress/mental health | No objective proof symptoms hormonal

## FINAL REMINDERS

This is **not fill-in-the-blank design**. You’re creating a brand system for medical technology that empowers women with objective health data—helps them conceive faster, proves pain is real, saves babies’ lives, validates perimenopause. Your interpretation of Ora’s personality, visual identity, and positioning is where creativity happens.

**Avoid women’s health clichés:** Baby pink everything | Flowers and butterflies | “Feminine” stereotypes | Stock photos perfect pregnant women | “Girl boss” empowerment language | Dismissing real struggles

**Ora is:** Serious health technology driven by understanding women’s medical needs | Sophisticated, evidence-based, validating, empowering

**Unique value proposition:** Medical-grade biometric data confirming reproductive health patterns vs. guessing | Giving providers objective patient data vs. dismissive “sounds like stress” responses

**Consider:** Multiple audiences (TTC, PCOS/endo, pregnant, perimenopausal) | Each faces medical dismissal, wants validation | Each needs data not guesswork | Each deserves to be taken seriously

**Keep asking yourself:**

- Does this build trust with someone who’s been dismissed by doctors?
- Does this feel validating (you’re not imagining—here’s proof) or condescending?
- Would an OB/GYN trust this data and use it for treatment?
- Does this differentiate Ora from fitness wearables clearly?
- Would someone with chronic pain feel seen and believed?
- Does this balance medical credibility with emotional warmth?
- Would anxious pregnant person feel reassured?
- Does this work equally for someone TTC and someone in perimenopause?

**This is portfolio-worthy work** demonstrating multi-audience design, medical device positioning, health data communication, building trust in sensitive categories, balancing clinical credibility with empathy, creating systems that empower rather than patronize.
