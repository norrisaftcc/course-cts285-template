# EventPro Creative Brief

**White-Label Application: Multi-Event Coordination System**  
**Core Platform: Task Management System (Platform #2 of 6)**

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

You are creating a complete brand identity and marketing campaign for **EventPro**, a physical + digital event management system designed for anyone coordinating multiple events simultaneously—professional event planners managing weddings and corporate galas, venue managers scheduling recurring programming, organizational coordinators running conferences and training sessions, and individuals planning major personal celebrations.

Your programming team partners are building the software platform. Your job is to create the brand that makes this product essential for anyone drowning in overlapping event timelines, vendor coordination, day-of schedules, and the constant question: “Which event needs my attention right now?”

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Multi-event coordinators ages 25-50 across professional and organizational contexts

**Demographics:**

- **Professional Event Planners:** Wedding planners, corporate event coordinators, party planners (typically managing 3-8 events simultaneously at different stages)
- **Venue Managers:** Coffee shops, galleries, community centers, libraries, churches scheduling regular programming (open mics, artist receptions, workshops, book clubs)
- **Corporate/Organizational Coordinators:** HR professionals running training/onboarding, education coordinators managing PD days, conference organizers
- **Personal Event Planners:** Individuals planning major life events (weddings, milestone birthdays, retirement parties, anniversary celebrations)
- Income varies widely by role ($35K-$100K+)
- Mix of full-time event professionals and people with event coordination as part of broader role

**Psychographics:**

- Detail-oriented but overwhelmed by volume of moving parts
- Pride themselves on flawless execution and client/attendee experience
- Frustrated by scattered information across emails, spreadsheets, vendor communications
- Anxious about forgetting critical details or missing vendor deadlines
- Value systems that prevent disasters before they happen
- Want to look professional and organized to clients/attendees/stakeholders
- Juggling multiple events at different planning stages simultaneously
- Feel like they’re always one missed detail away from catastrophe

**Current Behavior:**

- Use spreadsheets for timeline and vendor tracking (becomes overwhelming with multiple events)
- Physical binders or folders per event (can’t see across events easily)
- Email chains with vendors (information buried, hard to find)
- Separate tools for: budget tracking, vendor communication, timeline management, checklists
- Toggle between events constantly throughout planning cycle
- Manually update clients/attendees on event status
- Work evenings/weekends ensuring nothing falls through cracks
- Keep mental notes of “don’t forget to follow up with X vendor for Y event”

**What They’re Looking For:**

- ONE system to see all events and their status at a glance
- Clear view of which event needs attention this week
- Vendor/participant coordination without email archaeology
- Day-of timeline that actually works in the chaos
- Prevention of double-booking venues or resources
- Professional way to share event details with clients/attendees
- System that catches what they’re about to forget
- Ability to template recurring events (don’t rebuild open mic schedule every month)

### Company Background

**EventPro** was founded in 2021 by **Alicia Morrison**, who spent eight years as the events manager for a mid-sized community arts center in Portland. In that role, Alicia coordinated everything from gallery openings and concerts to workshops, fundraisers, and private rentals—often managing 15-20 events per month at various stages of planning.

The breaking point came during a particularly chaotic week in spring 2019. Alicia was coordinating a major fundraising gala, a weekly open mic series, two private wedding rentals, and a multi-day conference—all happening within a 10-day window. She had spreadsheets, binders, email threads, and sticky notes covering every surface of her desk.

On the day of the gala, she discovered the caterer had the wrong setup time because an email update had gotten buried. The florist showed up an hour late because Alicia had forgotten to send the revised timeline. The AV tech was confused about equipment needs because the information was in three different places. The event ultimately succeeded, but it took years off Alicia’s life and made her look disorganized to her board of directors.

That’s when she realized: the problem wasn’t her organizational skills—it was that event coordination tools were designed for people planning ONE big event (like a wedding), not for people managing MULTIPLE overlapping events simultaneously.

Alicia partnered with a developer friend and spent two years prototyping a system designed for her actual chaos: a visual command center showing all active events, their timelines, vendor status, and what needed attention right now. After beta testing with fellow venue managers and event professionals, she launched EventPro.

The company’s mission: **Enable flawless multi-event execution by making overlapping chaos visible and manageable.**

Alicia’s philosophy: “You’re not scattered. You’re managing ten different events that each have fifty moving parts. That’s not a you problem—that’s a tools problem. EventPro makes the chaos visible so nothing falls through the cracks.”

### Brand Personality

EventPro is the experienced coordinator who stays calm when everything’s happening at once.

**Brand Voice:**

- Professional and competent (builds trust)
- Practical and realistic about event chaos
- Calm under pressure (not frantic or stressed)
- “We understand multi-event coordination” credibility
- Confident about preventing disasters
- Supportive without being condescending

**Visual Identity Direction (your job to develop):**

- Should feel professional enough for corporate clients to see
- Organized and systematic (conveys control)
- Modern but approachable (not cold or sterile)
- Works across event types (weddings, corporate, community programming)
- Conveys reliability and attention to detail
- Appeals to both creative event planners and operational coordinators

**Not This:**

- Wedding-specific aesthetic (too narrow, excludes other users)
- Chaotic/creative/whimsical (undermines organization message)
- Corporate productivity culture (too stiff for creative events industry)
- Party/celebration aesthetic (trivializes professional event management)
- Overly minimalist (doesn’t communicate comprehensive tool)

### Campaign Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Position EventPro as the essential coordination system for anyone managing multiple events simultaneously who needs to prevent details from falling through the cracks.

**What Your Design Should Accomplish:**

1. **Build Professional Credibility Across Event Types**
- Must work for wedding planners AND corporate coordinators AND venue managers
- Visual identity can’t skew too “wedding” or too “corporate”
- Conveys serious professional tool, not consumer app
- Clients/attendees should be impressed when they see shared event details
1. **Address Multi-Event Chaos**
- Single-event tools (wedding planning apps) don’t work for people managing 5-10 simultaneous events
- Your branding must communicate: handles complexity, prevents disasters
- Focus on “see all your events, know what needs attention”
- Acknowledge reality of overlapping timelines without dwelling on stress
1. **Differentiate from Spreadsheets and Single-Event Tools**
- Many coordinators currently use Excel or Google Sheets—why switch?
- Wedding planning apps (The Knot, WeddingWire) don’t handle multiple events
- Project management tools (Asana, Monday) aren’t designed for event-specific needs
- Physical + digital = always visible command center, prevents forgetting
1. **Appeal to Multiple User Types**
- Professional event planners (primary market)
- Venue managers (recurring programming)
- Corporate coordinators (conferences, training)
- Personal event planners (secondary market)
- Show versatility without being generic
1. **Position as Business/Professional Investment**
- This costs money—justify the value
- ROI: prevented disasters, saved time, professional client impression
- Prevents reputation damage from missed details
- “Prevents one vendor disaster and it’s paid for itself”

### Why This Matters for Event Coordinators

**The Current Problem: Single-Event Tools for Multi-Event Reality**

Most event coordination tools are designed for someone planning ONE big event (their wedding, one conference). But professional coordinators, venue managers, and organizational staff manage 5-15 events simultaneously at different planning stages: next week’s gallery opening (final details), next month’s corporate retreat (vendor confirmations), next quarter’s fundraising gala (early planning).

Current reality: spreadsheets per event (can’t see across events), email threads with vendors (information buried), physical binders (live at desk, not accessible on-site), separate budget tracking (disconnected from planning), mental load of “which event needs attention today?” No system shows ALL events and their status at once.

What breaks: forgot to confirm vendor for Event A because focused on Event B crisis, double-booked venue because didn’t see conflict across events, missed budget overrun on Event C until too late, day-of timeline fell apart because information scattered across emails and notes, looked disorganized to client because couldn’t quickly answer “what’s the status?”

**How EventPro’s Features Address This:**

**Multi-Event Visual Command Center:** The display board shows all active events color-coded by pin. Before your day starts, you see: Blue Event (wedding Saturday) needs final vendor confirmations this week, Green Event (corporate training Thursday) has budget overrun, Yellow Event (monthly open mic Friday) is on track. You know exactly where to focus attention without opening five different spreadsheets.

**Prevents Coordination Disasters:** Timeline management with vendor coordination means everyone knows who should be where when. Day-of timeline accessible on phone during event execution. Update in real-time if caterer’s late—everyone sees adjusted schedule immediately. Client/vendor portal shares timeline automatically—no manual “here’s the updated schedule” emails.

**Handles Recurring Events Efficiently:** Venue managers running monthly open mics, weekly workshops, or seasonal programming can save successful events as templates. Next month’s open mic starts with last month’s timeline, vendor list, and checklist—adjust specifics, don’t rebuild from scratch every time.

**Budget Protection Across Events:** Track estimated vs. actual costs per event. System alerts when Event A’s florals are 20% over budget while you’re focused on Event B. See total committed costs across all active events to understand cash flow and capacity.

**Professional Client Experience:** Share event portal with couple planning wedding, corporate client booking conference, or community members attending workshop. They see their event timeline, vendor status, and planning progress without seeing your other events. Look organized and professional without doing extra work.

**Resource Conflict Prevention:** Managing multiple events in same venue or with shared resources (AV equipment, staff, vehicles)? EventPro prevents double-booking. Alerts when you’re about to schedule Event A’s setup during Event B’s teardown in same space.

**Mobile + Physical = Complete Coverage:** Physical board in office for planning and oversight. Mobile app for vendor calls, on-site event coordination, quick updates between events. Never disconnected from your event portfolio.

**Different from Single-Event Apps and Spreadsheets:** Wedding planning apps (The Knot, WeddingWire) only handle one event—useless if you’re coordinating ten events. Spreadsheets can’t show cross-event conflicts, don’t sync to mobile, require manual updates. Project management tools (Asana, Monday) aren’t built for event-specific needs like day-of timelines, vendor coordination, or client portals. EventPro is purpose-built for managing multiple simultaneous events with event-specific workflows.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Maya—The Wedding Planner Juggling Five Ceremonies

**Background:**
Maya is a 34-year-old professional wedding planner running her own boutique wedding planning business for six years. She typically manages 4-6 weddings simultaneously at different planning stages—some couples are 12 months out (early planning), others are 3 months away (vendor finalizations), one wedding is this Saturday (execution mode). She works from a home office and is on-site for events on weekends. Her business depends on flawless execution and word-of-mouth referrals.

**Current System:**
Maya uses a combination of Google Sheets (timeline and vendor tracking per wedding), physical binders (contracts and notes per couple), Gmail (all vendor communication), QuickBooks (invoicing and budget tracking), and a massive wall calendar showing all wedding dates. She creates detailed day-of timelines in Word documents. She uses her phone for everything during actual wedding days.

**Pain Points:**

- Context-switching between weddings is mentally exhausting—she’ll be finalizing Couple A’s catering, then Couple B calls about florals, then she realizes she forgot to confirm photographer for Couple C
- She missed a vendor deadline for one wedding because she was in crisis mode with another wedding that weekend
- During a wedding last month, the florist showed up an hour late because Maya had emailed an updated timeline but the florist didn’t see it in their inbox chaos
- Couples ask “what’s the status on X?” and Maya has to open three different files to answer
- She can’t see budget status across all weddings—discovered one wedding was 25% over budget only when doing month-end reconciliation
- Day-of timelines are in Word docs on her laptop—had to pull over while driving to venue to check vendor arrival time
- She’s considering turning down new clients because managing five weddings simultaneously feels like her maximum capacity

**Quote:**
*“I love creating beautiful weddings, but I’m drowning in coordination. I have five couples, each with 15-20 vendors, each wedding with 50+ moving parts. That’s hundreds of details I’m tracking across spreadsheets and email and notes. One forgotten vendor confirmation or one missed timeline update can ruin someone’s wedding day. I need to see all my weddings at once and know immediately what needs my attention today.”*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board in home office shows all five weddings color-coded: see at a glance which weddings have urgent tasks this week
- By Event view: click Wedding A, see all their vendors, timeline, budget, tasks—instant context without opening five spreadsheets
- Vendor communication log: searchable record of all conversations with Couple B’s florist—no email archaeology
- Budget tracking alerts: “Wedding C is 20% over budget” notification before it becomes crisis
- Mobile timeline access: day-of schedule for Saturday’s wedding accessible on phone during event—update in real-time if vendor late
- Shared couple portals: couples see their wedding timeline and vendor status without manual updates from Maya
- Capacity planning: see total workload across all five weddings to evaluate if she can take Wedding #6

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **handles multiple events without dropping details**. Maya is competent but at capacity. Messaging around “see all your events,” “never miss a vendor deadline,” and “flawless execution” will resonate. Visual metaphors of command center, overview, and control.

### User Story 2: James—The Community Center Event Manager

**Background:**
James is a 29-year-old events coordinator for a mid-sized community center in a suburban area. He manages 15-20 events per month including recurring programming (weekly yoga classes, monthly art receptions, twice-monthly film screenings) and one-time rentals (birthday parties, small weddings, corporate meetings). Events range from 10 to 200 attendees. He works in a small office at the center and is on-site for most events. His role is 50% event coordination, 50% community outreach and marketing.

**Current System:**
James uses a massive Google Sheet with all events, a physical wall calendar in his office showing bookings, Gmail for all participant/vendor communication, and individual Google Docs for each event’s timeline and checklist. He tracks payments and deposits in a separate spreadsheet. He posts event information to the center’s website manually.

**Pain Points:**

- He double-booked the main hall twice this year because his spreadsheet didn’t flag the conflict—had to scramble to move one event to smaller room (embarrassing)
- Recurring events require rebuilding schedules every time: monthly film screening has same basic structure but he recreates timeline and vendor list each month
- A yoga instructor asked “what time do I have access for setup?” and James had to search through three months of emails to find the original conversation
- During last month’s art reception, the catering arrived 30 minutes late because James had verbally updated the time but never sent written confirmation
- He can’t quickly see “which events this month are over budget vs. under budget”—discovers budget issues only when reconciling at month-end
- Community members attending workshops ask “what’s on the schedule?” and James types up event info manually for each inquiry
- He’s on-site for events but his timeline and checklist live in Google Docs on his laptop—can’t easily access from phone while setting up

**Quote:**
*“I’m coordinating 20 events at different stages constantly. This week I’ve got final details for Saturday’s wedding rental, setup for tonight’s film screening, and early planning for next month’s fundraiser. I need to template our recurring events so I’m not rebuilding the same yoga class schedule every week, and I need to stop double-booking the venue because I didn’t see the conflict in my spreadsheet. I feel like I’m always one step behind.”*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board shows all 15-20 active events: instantly see which events are this week vs. next month, which need attention
- Recurring event templates: save “Monthly Film Screening” template with standard timeline, vendor list, checklist—next month’s screening starts pre-populated
- Venue conflict detection: system alerts when James tries to book event in main hall already reserved for different event
- Searchable communication log: “What did yoga instructor say about setup time?” answered in 10 seconds instead of email searching
- Mobile timeline access: tonight’s film screening checklist accessible on phone during setup
- Event portal for community: share upcoming workshop schedule, attendees RSVP directly without emailing James
- Budget tracking across all events: see which events are trending over/under budget at a glance

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **efficiency for high-volume recurring programming**. James manages many events but they’re smaller scale than weddings. Messaging around “template recurring events,” “prevent double-booking,” and “stop rebuilding schedules” will resonate. Visual identity should work for community/cultural organizations, not just high-end events.

### User Story 3: Priya—The Corporate Training Coordinator

**Background:**
Priya is a 42-year-old learning and development coordinator for a regional healthcare organization with 800 employees. She manages all employee training, professional development sessions, new hire onboarding, and mandatory compliance training. She coordinates 8-12 training events per month ranging from 2-hour workshops to 3-day conferences. Events happen at main office, satellite locations, and occasionally external venues. She works with external facilitators, internal subject matter experts, and manages registration for all sessions.

**Current System:**
Priya uses Outlook calendar for event dates, Excel spreadsheets for registration tracking and vendor management, email for all facilitator communication, and PowerPoint for creating session agendas. She creates printed handouts with schedules for each training session. Her organization uses an LMS (learning management system) for course content but not for event logistics.

**Pain Points:**

- She’s coordinating fall professional development days (3 full days, 40+ sessions, 15 external facilitators) while also managing weekly new hire orientation and monthly compliance training—can’t see across all events easily
- Registration tracking is manual in spreadsheet—doesn’t know if sessions are at capacity until she manually counts
- Last month’s leadership training: facilitator asked “where do I send my invoice?” and Priya had to search emails for contract details
- Day-of PD sessions: printed schedule had wrong room number for afternoon session because Priya updated digital version but didn’t reprint
- She forgot to confirm AV equipment for satellite location training until day before—nearly caused disaster
- Employees ask “what’s the agenda for next week’s workshop?” and Priya emails agenda individually instead of having shareable link
- Budget tracking across all training events is done monthly in retrospect—can’t proactively manage spending

**Quote:**
*“I’m managing 10-12 training events at any given time, from small workshops to large conferences with hundreds of attendees. Between vendor coordination, registration tracking, facility logistics, and materials preparation, I have a million details to track. I need one system where I can see: which events are this month, who’s registered, which facilitators need follow-up, what’s the budget status. Right now I’m in five different tools and I’m terrified I’m going to forget something critical.”*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board shows all training events: see fall PD days (Blue), weekly orientations (Green), monthly compliance (Yellow) simultaneously
- Task breakdown: break 3-day PD conference into phases (registration, facilitator confirmations, materials prep, venue setup, day-of execution)
- Facilitator coordination: contact info, contracts, communication log, deliverable status all in one place per event
- Registration tracking: see capacity per session, waitlist management
- Shared event portals: employees access workshop agendas and schedules via link—no manual emails
- Budget tracking per event: see spending across all events, get alerts when event trending over budget
- Mobile day-of access: full schedule and checklist accessible on phone during multi-day conference
- Template recurring events: monthly compliance training starts with established structure, adjust specifics

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **professional coordination for organizational events**. Priya needs serious business tool, not wedding aesthetic. Messaging around “manage complex multi-day events,” “registration tracking,” and “never miss facilitator deadline” will resonate. Visual identity must work in corporate/organizational contexts.

### User Story 4: Sophie—Planning Her Own Wedding While Working Full-Time

**Background:**
Sophie is a 28-year-old marketing manager planning her wedding for next June (8 months away). She’s working full-time while coordinating the wedding herself—she considered hiring a planner but decided to save the $3,000-5,000 cost and do it herself. She’s organized by nature but has never planned an event of this scale. She’s managing 12 vendors (venue, caterer, photographer, DJ, florist, baker, rentals, etc.) and a budget of $35,000.

**Current System:**
Sophie uses a wedding planning app (The Knot), Google Sheets for budget tracking, a physical binder with contracts and magazine clippings, email for all vendor communication, and Pinterest for inspiration. She has a running note in her phone with her to-do list. She meets with vendors on evenings and weekends around her full-time work schedule.

**Pain Points:**

- The Knot app is great for inspiration and checklists but doesn’t help her coordinate 12 different vendors with different timelines and deliverables
- She’s tracking vendor payments in Google Sheets but it’s disconnected from her planning—she missed a deposit deadline last month
- Vendor communication is scattered across email threads—when her mom asked “what time is the photographer arriving?” Sophie spent 15 minutes finding the email
- She’s anxious about the day-of timeline: she’s created a schedule in Google Docs but how does she share it with all vendors and wedding party?
- She can’t visualize “what needs to happen this month vs. next month”—everything feels urgent
- Her fiancé asks “what’s the status on X?” and Sophie has to check three different places to answer
- She’s losing sleep worrying she’s forgetting something important

**Quote:**
*“Planning a wedding while working full-time is so much harder than I expected. I have 12 vendors, a million decisions to make, and I’m terrified I’m going to forget something important. The wedding apps are good for checklists and inspiration but they don’t actually help me coordinate all these vendors and manage the timeline. I need something that shows me: what needs to happen this week, which vendors I need to follow up with, and helps me create a day-of timeline that I can actually share with everyone.”*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Single event view optimized for deep focus: all wedding tasks, vendors, timeline, budget in one visual system
- Vendor management: track all 12 vendors, their deliverables, payment status, communication history
- Budget tracking: see estimated vs. actual spending in real-time, alerts when approaching budget limits
- Task breakdown: overwhelming wedding planning → manageable monthly phases → weekly tasks
- Timeline creation: build minute-by-minute day-of schedule, share with all vendors and wedding party via portal
- Shared portal: vendors and wedding party access timeline and details—no more “what time should I arrive?” emails
- Mobile access: wedding timeline accessible on phone during actual wedding day
- Peace of mind: visual confirmation that nothing’s forgotten, everything’s tracked

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must work for **personal event planning** as secondary market. Sophie isn’t a professional but needs professional-grade coordination. Messaging around “coordinate complex events even if you’re not a professional planner” and “stop worrying you’ve forgotten something” will resonate. Visual identity shouldn’t be so corporate it alienates personal users.

## Current Behaviors & Why Existing Solutions Fail

**What Event Coordinators Currently Use:**

1. **Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)**
- **Why it fails:** Can’t see across multiple events easily. No mobile access during events. Doesn’t sync. Manual updates. No vendor collaboration. No timeline visualization. Becomes overwhelming with many events.
1. **Wedding Planning Apps (The Knot, WeddingWire, Zola)**
- **Why it fails:** Designed for one event only. Useless for professionals managing 5-10 events. Consumer-focused, not professional-grade. Limited vendor coordination. Can’t template recurring events.
1. **Project Management Tools (Asana, Monday, Trello)**
- **Why it fails:** Not designed for event-specific workflows (day-of timelines, vendor coordination). Steep learning curve. No client/attendee portals. Overkill for simple events, insufficient for complex multi-event management.
1. **Email + Calendar**
- **Why it fails:** Vendor communication buried in threads. Can’t find past conversations. Calendar shows when, not what/who/how. No budget tracking. Information scattered. No collaboration.
1. **Event Management Software (Cvent, Eventbrite)**
- **Why it fails:** Designed for large conferences/ticketed events. Expensive. Overkill for small events. Complex setup. Registration-focused, not coordination-focused.
1. **Physical Binders/Folders**
- **Why it fails:** Lives at desk, not accessible on-site. Can’t see across multiple events. No search. No alerts. Can’t share with vendors/clients. Static.
1. **Combination of Multiple Tools**
- **Why it fails:** Budget in QuickBooks, timeline in Word, vendor list in Excel, communication in email, inspiration in Pinterest. Nothing talks to each other. Increases cognitive load rather than reducing it.

**The Pattern:**
Single-event tools don’t scale to multiple simultaneous events. Spreadsheets can’t handle coordination complexity. Project management tools aren’t event-specific. Nothing provides ambient awareness of multi-event status. Nothing integrates planning, coordination, budget, and client communication. Nothing works as well in office (planning) as on-site (execution).

**What Event Coordinators Actually Need:**
A system **designed for managing multiple events simultaneously** (not adapted from single-event or generic project tools), **always visible** (command center view of all events), **always accessible** (mobile during on-site coordination), **event-specific workflows** (timelines, vendor management, day-of execution), **client/vendor collaboration** (share details without email), and **prevents disasters** (conflict detection, deadline alerts, budget warnings).
