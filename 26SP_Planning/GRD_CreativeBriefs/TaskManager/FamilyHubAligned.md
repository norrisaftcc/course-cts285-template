-----

## Company Background

### About FamilyHub Inc.

FamilyHub was founded in 2024 by Rachel Kim and Marcus Thompson, two working parents who met at their kids' school pickup line while frantically coordinating schedules via phone. After one too many "Wait, who's taking Emma to soccer?" moments, they realized that existing task apps were built for professionals and individuals—not for the unique chaos of family life.

### Mission

Reduce the mental load on parents by empowering the whole family to see, share, and own their responsibilities together.

### Core Values

- **Shared Responsibility:** Everyone contributes, not just the "family manager"
- **Peace of Mind:** Less chaos, fewer dropped balls, more breathing room
- **Simplicity First:** If it's too complicated, families won't use it
- **Visibility for All:** Information shouldn't live in one person's head
- **Real-World Awareness:** We know families aren't perfect—our product adapts to actual family life, not an ideal

### Brand Personality

FamilyHub is the supportive friend who "gets it." Empathetic but not condescending. Practical but not cold. Warm but not saccharine. The brand understands that parenting is hard, family coordination is exhausting, and nobody needs another thing that requires perfection. FamilyHub celebrates progress over perfection and sanity over Pinterest-worthy organization.

**Voice Characteristics:**

- Understanding (not judgmental)
- Encouraging (not preachy)
- Helpful (not bossy)
- Human (not corporate)
- Inclusive (recognizes diverse family structures)

-----

## What This Campaign Needs to Do

**Main goal:**
Get 10,000 families to buy FamilyHub in the first 6 months.

**How to do that:**

1. **Build trust**
- Show that real parents created this product
- Prove it actually works for real families
- Look professional and reliable, not gimmicky
1. **Show it's simple**
- Setup is easy
- Daily use doesn't take extra time
- The whole family can use it (not just tech-savvy people)
1. **Make the value clear**
- Parents immediately understand the problem it solves
- They see why it's worth buying
- The benefit is obvious, not vague
1. **Get people to buy**
- Turn awareness into action
- Make it easy to understand what they're buying (physical board + app)
- Give them a reason to buy now, not later

-----

## What Your Design Should Accomplish

Your campaign deliverables should achieve the following:

✅ **Make the problem instantly recognizable** - Parents should see themselves in the pain point
✅ **Show the solution clearly** - Viewers should immediately understand how FamilyHub works
✅ **Feel approachable and realistic** - Not another "perfect family" fantasy product
✅ **Build credibility** - Look professional and trustworthy, not gimmicky
✅ **Motivate action** - Create genuine desire to purchase and try the product
✅ **Speak the language of your audience** - Use terms and tone parents actually use

-----

## Brand Positioning & Key Messages

### What Makes FamilyHub Different

**The main idea:**
FamilyHub helps overwhelmed parents by making family schedules and tasks visible to everyone. Parents stop being the only person who knows what's happening. The whole family can see what needs to be done and who's responsible for it.

### Primary Message

**"Finally, everyone knows what's happening."**

What this captures:

- Relief: Parents don't have to remember everything alone
- Freedom: Family members can take ownership
- Peace: Nothing gets forgotten

### Other Messages You Can Use

- "Stop being your family's human reminder system"
- "One place everyone can see and update"
- "The mental load, shared"
- "Because 'What's for dinner?' shouldn't be asked 47 times"
- "Tasks that everyone owns, not just you"

### Messages to Avoid (Don't Use These)

- Anything that makes families without this product feel like failures
- Perfect, Pinterest-style organization (this isn't realistic)
- Complicated or tech-heavy language (this should feel easy)
- Assuming only moms manage the home (dads parent too)
- Talking down to parents or kids

# PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

*Reference this section when you need to understand the product in detail.*

-----

## What FamilyHub Is

FamilyHub helps families organize tasks, schedules, and chores in one place.

**Two parts work together:**

1. **Physical display board** - An interactive screen that hangs on the wall (like a wall-mounted tablet)
1. **Digital app** - An app on phones and computers

Both parts show the same information. Update one, and the other updates automatically.

**Professional terminology:** This is called a "hybrid digital-physical system" or "synchronized cross-platform solution with tangible interface."

-----

## What's in the Box

When families buy FamilyHub, they get:

**Interactive digital display board (18 inches wide, 24 inches tall)**

- Touch screen with stylus for handwriting
- Can write directly on the screen
- Mounts on wall (kitchen, family room, mudroom)

**Smart magnetic pins in different colors**

- Each family member gets their own color
- Example: Red pins = Mom, Blue pins = Dad, Green pins = Child 1, Yellow pins = Child 2
- Place a colored pin on the display and write a task → automatically assigns to that person
- System recognizes pin color and converts handwriting to digital text

**Additional items:**

- Wall mount hardware
- Setup instructions
- Code to download the mobile app

The box is designed to be sold in stores like Target or Walmart, and online.

**Professional terminology:** This is "retail packaging for big-box and e-commerce distribution channels with smart home technology integration."

-----

## How It Actually Works

### Adding a task on the physical display:

1. Grab a red pin (Mom's color)
1. Place it on the display screen
1. Write with the stylus: "Take out trash - Tuesday"
1. System recognizes: Red pin = Mom's task
1. Handwriting converts to text automatically
1. Task appears in Mom's phone app immediately
1. Shows on the display board

### Adding a task in the app:

1. Open app on phone
1. Create task: "Take out trash - Tuesday"
1. Assign to Mom (tap her profile)
1. Task appears on wall display immediately
1. Red pin indicator shows on the display

**Both directions sync in real-time.**

-----

## Product Features

### Task and Schedule Management

- Create tasks and assign to family members *(task assignment and delegation)*
- Set due dates and times *(deadline management)*
- Mark tasks complete *(progress tracking)*
- Recurring tasks (daily chores, weekly activities) *(automation)*
- Shared tasks that require multiple people *(collaborative assignments)*

### Multiple Views for Different Needs

- **Individual view:** See just one person's tasks (Mom's tasks, Child 1's tasks, etc.)
- **Shared tasks view:** Tasks requiring multiple people (family dinner, clean garage together)
- **Today view:** What's happening right now for everyone
- **Week view:** Plan ahead, see the next 7 days
- **Month calendar view:** Full month overview with all commitments
  - Shows visual density: "Friday the 12th is packed with 5 things scheduled"
  - Color-coded by person to see distribution
  - Helps prevent over-scheduling

### Conflict Detection & Alerts

- Detects scheduling conflicts: "Soccer practice and piano lesson both at 4pm"
- Warns about overload: "5 commitments on Friday - too much?"
- Identifies assignment conflicts: "Mom assigned to 3 tasks at same time"
- Alerts appear on BOTH the wall display (visual warning) and phone app (push notification)
- Catches problems before they happen

### Additional Features

- Meal planning visibility ("What's for dinner?" is answered on the board)
- Shopping list (add items from board or app)
- Reminder notifications (on phone and display)
- Family calendar with everyone's events
- Photo/note attachments to tasks

**Professional terminology:** The system provides "real-time synchronization, conflict detection algorithms, multi-user task delegation, and customizable view filtering."

-----

## Why Physical + Digital?

### Physical board solves:

- At-a-glance visibility (everyone sees it walking by)
- No need to open an app to check
- Tactile interaction (kids can touch, move pins, write notes)
- Central family meeting point
- Works when phones are dead or lost

### Digital app solves:

- Update from anywhere (at work, in the car, at the store)
- Notifications and reminders on your phone
- Different views for different planning needs
- Search and filter capabilities
- Historical tracking

### Together:

Combines the visibility of a physical board with the power of digital organization.

**Professional terminology:** "Multi-modal interface design optimizing for both ambient awareness and mobile accessibility."

-----

## The Problem FamilyHub Solves

### Before FamilyHub:

- One parent (usually Mom) remembers everything
- Kids ask the same questions every day: "What's happening today?" "What's for dinner?" "Who's picking me up?"
- Information is scattered: some on sticky notes, some in texts, some on a whiteboard, most in one person's head
- The parent who remembers everything gets exhausted
- Other family members don't know what they're supposed to do
- Things get forgotten
- Conflicts discovered too late: "Wait, we have TWO things at 5pm?"

**The real problem:** One person holds all the information. Everyone else has to ask that person everything. Scheduling conflicts aren't caught until it's too late.

### With FamilyHub:

- Information is visible to everyone (on wall and in phones)
- Family members can check for themselves instead of asking
- Tasks are assigned clearly with colored pins - everyone knows what they're responsible for
- When something changes, everyone sees the update immediately
- System catches scheduling conflicts and warns you
- Month view shows when you're over-scheduled before it becomes a problem
- The parent isn't the only one who knows what's happening

### Result:

- Less "Mom, what's for dinner?" and more "I can see it on the board"
- Fewer missed appointments because conflicts were caught early
- Better family planning because you can see the whole month's density

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

*Use this section to understand the emotional context and real needs of your audience.*

-----

## User Stories

These are real examples from parents who need FamilyHub. These stories help you understand who you're designing for and what problems they face.

### Story 1: The Parent Who Answers Questions All Day

**What they said:**
"I have three kids. All day long they ask me: 'What's happening today?' 'Who's picking me up?' 'What's for dinner?' I need one place where they can look and see the answer themselves. I'm tired of being a human reminder system."

**What this means:**
The problem isn't just remembering things. It's being interrupted constantly. Parents can't focus on work or anything else because they're answering the same questions over and over.

**Design takeaway:** Show how FamilyHub stops the constant questioning.

-----

### Story 2: The Parent Who Tracks Everything Alone

**What they said:**
"I'm the only one who knows what needs to be done around the house. I track all the chores, meals, and schedules. Everyone benefits, but only I do the mental work of managing it all. I need a system where everyone can see what needs to be done."

**What this means:**
When information is invisible, one person has to carry all of it in their head. That's exhausting.

**Design takeaway:** Show how FamilyHub makes invisible work visible to everyone.

-----

### Story 3: The Parent Teaching Kids Responsibility

**What they said:**
"I want my kids to be responsible and independent. But I have to remind them constantly. I need a system they can check themselves so I don't have to nag them about every task."

**What this means:**
Kids can't be independent if they don't have access to information. They keep asking parents because they don't know where else to look.

**Design takeaway:** Show how FamilyHub helps kids take ownership of their responsibilities.

-----

### Story 4: The Parent Managing Multiple Schedules

**What they said:**
"I coordinate activities for multiple kids. I need to see everyone's schedule in one place. When something changes, I need everyone to know immediately. Otherwise I forget someone's practice or double-book."

**What this means:**
Family schedules are complicated and always changing. If only one person knows the schedule, mistakes happen.

**Design takeaway:** Show how FamilyHub keeps everyone informed when things change.

-----

## What Motivates Purchase

### What would make a parent actually buy this?

**Immediate relief:**

- "This will stop the constant 'Mom, what's for dinner?' questions"
- "I won't be the only one who remembers everything anymore"
- "My kids can finally see what they're supposed to do"

**Practical value:**

- "This catches scheduling conflicts before they become problems"
- "The whole family can stay coordinated without me being the hub"
- "It works both physically and digitally - I can update from anywhere"

**Trust factors:**

- "Real parents created this"
- "It's not complicated or tech-heavy"
- "Other families are using it successfully"
- "I can see exactly how it works - no mystery"

**Price justification:**

- "This will save me hours of coordination time per week"
- "Fewer missed appointments means less stress"
- "Teaching my kids independence is worth it"
- "If it reduces even 10% of my mental load, it's worth the investment"

-----

## Current Behaviors

### How do families currently manage tasks and schedules?

**Paper-based:**

- Wall calendars (but only one person updates them)
- Sticky notes (that fall off and get lost)
- Whiteboards (that nobody looks at)
- Printable chore charts (that kids ignore)

**Digital:**

- Phone calendar apps (but only parent's phone has everything)
- Family group texts (where information gets buried)
- Reminder apps (that only remind the person who set them)
- Spreadsheets (too complicated for daily use)

**Mental:**

- One parent remembers everything (exhausting)
- Kids ask questions instead of checking anywhere
- Information lives in someone's head (not accessible)

**Why these fail:**

- Not visible to whole family
- Only one person maintains them
- No automatic reminders
- Don't catch conflicts
- Not accessible from everywhere

**What families really need:**

- Visible to everyone
- Easy for everyone to update
- Works both at home (physical) and away (digital)
- Catches conflicts before they happen
- Reduces the burden on one person

# PART 4: STRATEGIC GUIDANCE

*Use this section when planning your deliverables and justifying your choices.*

-----

## Deliverable Selection Strategy

In **Milestone 1**, you will submit a strategic plan explaining which deliverables you're creating and why. Your choices must make sense for how busy parents discover products, evaluate them, and decide to purchase.

-----

## Print Deliverables - Strategic Questions

**Choose 2 print deliverables.** Before choosing, answer these questions:

### Where do busy parents actually spend time?

Think beyond the obvious pediatrician's office:

- Where does the stressed parent go? (Therapist offices, counseling centers)
- Where do they sign kids up for activities? (Recreation centers, sports facilities, dance studios)
- Where do they make daily decisions? (Grocery store aisles asking "what's for dinner?")
- Where do they wait with time to read? (Orthodontist, eye doctor, hair salon)
- Where are they thinking about family logistics? (School pickup lines, carpool lanes)

### What print format actually works in that space?

Don't default to flat posters and flyers. Consider:

- **Dimensional pieces:** Pop-up mailers, die-cut shapes, folded structures
- **Point-of-purchase displays:** Shelf talkers, counter displays, hanging signs
- **Promotional items people keep:** Magnetic notepad for fridge, calendar card, bookmark, lanyard with tag
- **Interesting folds:** Gate-folds, accordion folds, French folds, roll-folds
- **Interactive pieces:** Peel-away layers, tear-off tabs, pop-outs
- **Functional items:** Shopping list pads, meal planning cards, schedule templates

### What makes someone actually engage with it?

- Does it solve an immediate problem?
- Is it useful enough to keep?
- Does the physical format surprise them or add value?
- Would they take it home or just walk past?

### Your Milestone 1 plan must explain:

- Specifically what you're creating (not just "brochure" - what kind? what fold? why?)
- Where it will be (not just "grocery store" - which aisle? at what point in shopping?)
- Why a parent would engage with it (not just "they'll see it" - why would they care?)
- How the physical format enhances the message

-----

## Digital Deliverables - Strategic Questions

**Choose 2 digital deliverables.** Before choosing, answer these questions:

### Where do busy parents make decisions online?

Don't just say "social media." Be specific:

- Which platform? Why that one?
- What are they doing there? (Scrolling for escape? Looking for solutions? Asking for advice?)
- When do they see it? (Late night phone scrolling? Morning commute? Weekend research?)

### What digital format makes sense for your message?

**Social Media Campaigns:**

- Not a single post - a cohesive series (3-5 pieces minimum)
- What format? Feed posts, Stories, Reels, carousel ads?
- Static images or motion graphics?
- What makes them stop scrolling vs. keep going?

**App/Device Interface Design:**

- Key screens of the mobile app (login, dashboard, task view, calendar)
- Display board interface screens (home view, month view, assignment view)
- How does your brand translate to functional UI?
- Does it maintain brand personality while being usable?

**Email Marketing:**

- Who's receiving it? (New customer acquisition or existing user retention?)
- What's the subject line that gets opened?
- What's the single action you want them to take?
- How does design support that action?

**App Store/E-Commerce Presence:**

- App icon that works at tiny sizes
- Screenshot mockups for app store listing
- Amazon/e-commerce product images
- How do you communicate value in 3 seconds?

**Video-Related Graphics:**

- YouTube thumbnail that drives clicks
- Video intro/outro graphics
- Animated storyboard frames
- Motion graphics style frames
  (Note: You're designing graphics, not producing video)

**Web Graphics:**

- Banner ads (specific dimensions for specific placements)
- Landing page hero graphics
- Product feature callouts
- Social proof/testimonial graphics

### Your Milestone 1 plan must explain:

- Specifically what you're creating (with format details)
- Which platform and why (backed by audience research)
- What user action or mindset you're designing for
- How this fits in the purchase journey (awareness, consideration, conversion)

-----

## Multi-Page Layout - Strategic Questions

**Choose 1 multi-page layout (minimum 8 pages/slides).**

### What This Is:

A designed print document or presentation. Examples:

- Product catalog
- Sales pitch deck
- User guide / Getting started manual
- Educational guide for parents
- Retail buyer presentation
- Direct mail catalog
- Corporate partnership proposal

### What This Is NOT:

- Website design (that's a digital deliverable)
- Social media carousel (that's a digital deliverable)
- Single-page designs repeated 8 times
- Brand guidelines booklet (that's internal, not consumer-facing)

### Before Choosing, Ask:

**Who needs an 8+ page document about FamilyHub?**

- Parents deciding whether to buy it?
- New users learning how to set it up?
- Retail buyers deciding whether to stock it?
- Press/media writing about it?
- Corporate HR evaluating it for employee programs?

**What story does it need to tell across multiple pages?**

- How to set up and start using the product?
- Product features and benefits for consideration?
- How to use it?
- Why it's better than alternatives?
- The business case for retailers or corporate buyers?

**What format makes sense?**

- Printed booklet they can hold?
- Slide presentation they can flip through?
- Digital PDF they can download?
- Catalog they can reference?

**How does this support your campaign?**

- Does it reach your target audience?
- Does it move them closer to purchase?
- Does it fill a gap your other deliverables don't cover?

**Your Milestone 1 plan must justify this choice.**

-----

## Questions to Guide Your Research

### Audience Research

- What are the daily pain points for parents managing family schedules?
- Where do parents discover new organizational products?
- What language do they use when describing household coordination challenges?
- What builds trust with this audience - testimonials? Expert endorsements? The parent-founder story?
- What would make a parent choose this over free apps or paper calendars?

### Deliverable Strategy

- Which of your deliverables reaches parents during awareness? (They don't know FamilyHub exists)
- Which reaches them during consideration? (They're researching solutions)
- Which drives them to purchase? (They're ready to buy)
- Where are the gaps in your campaign coverage?

### Design Decisions

- How do you visually show "mental load" or "family chaos" without being negative?
- What does "relief" or "peace of mind" look like in design?
- How do you show both the physical display and the digital app clearly?
- What photography or illustration style feels authentic to real families vs. stock-photo-perfect families?

### Brand Application

- Does your logo work at both large scale (packaging, posters) and small scale (app icon, social media)?
- Can your color palette work across playful kid-facing materials and trustworthy parent-facing sales materials?
- Does your typography feel accessible and friendly while maintaining credibility?

-----

## Collaboration with Programming Students

### Your Programming Partners

You will be working with a programming team that is building the core Task Management Platform. While you're creating the FamilyHub brand for families, other design students in your peer group are creating brands for different audiences using the same technical platform (students, freelancers, event planners, homeowners, corporate teams).

### How Collaboration Works

**Weeks 1-8:** Programming students are building the platform's core features based on user needs across all markets.

**You can help each other:**

- **You ask them:** "Can the platform support [feature]?" "What are the technical limitations?" "How does [functionality] actually work?"
- **They ask you:** "What features matter most to families?" "How would parents use this differently than students or freelancers?" "What would build trust with your audience?"

**Week 8:** You'll present your complete campaign. Programming students will see how their ONE platform serves multiple markets through different branding.

### Scheduled Touchpoints

- **Week 1-2:** Joint kickoff and brainstorming
- **Week 4:** Peer review (programming team may attend)
- **Week 6:** Peer review (programming team may attend)
- **Week 8:** Final presentations - programming team attends

### What to Ask Programming Students

- What are the core features of the platform?
- Are there any technical constraints I should know about?
- Would [specific feature I'm promoting] be realistic?
- How customizable is the display interface for different brands?
- What's technically possible vs. what's in the current build?

### What They Might Ask You

- What specific features does the family market need most?
- How would families discover and adopt this product?
- What language/terminology makes sense for family users?
- What would make parents trust and pay for this?

-----

## Final Notes

### Your Research Task

You need to discover for yourself:

- What products already exist in this space
- Where parents currently go for solutions
- What language they use to describe their problems
- What builds trust with this specific audience
- Where they discover new products

**Don't just Google "family organization products."** Think deeper:

- Where do overwhelmed parents spend time?
- What are they already reading, watching, following?
- Who influences their purchasing decisions?
- What problems are they actively trying to solve right now?

This research will inform every design decision you make.

-----

## Final Notes

**Think like a strategist, not just a designer.**

Beautiful design that doesn't connect with the audience or support business goals is just decoration. Your job is to create a campaign that would actually work in the real world.

**The best campaigns will:**

- Show deep understanding of target audience pain points
- Make strategic, justified deliverable choices
- Execute with professional-level craft
- Work cohesively as a unified brand experience
- Demonstrate how design drives business outcomes

**You're not just making pretty things. You're solving a communication problem for a real product serving real people.**

# PART 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

*This section bridges your creative vision to the technical platform being built by programming students.*

-----

## Overview: Design Meets Development

FamilyHub is one of six white-label applications built on the **Task Management Platform™**, a flexible system developed by programming students in CSC 289. Understanding how your design choices translate to platform capabilities helps you create implementation-aware, realistic designs.

**The core insight:** FamilyHub, StudyStream, FreelanceFlow, EventPro, RenovateRight, and TeamFlow™ all use the same database, task logic, and core features. What makes FamilyHub distinct is the terminology, visual design, and feature emphasis you create—not custom code.

**Why this matters for designers:**

- Your color palette becomes CSS variables programmers can implement
- Your terminology choices map to configuration files
- Your interface mockups guide actual screen development
- Your brand personality influences notification language and user flow

This isn't theoretical. Programming students may implement your FamilyHub theme as a demonstration of the platform's white-label flexibility. Understanding the technical foundation helps you design within realistic constraints while pushing creative boundaries.

-----

## 5.1 Engine Capability Mapping

### How FamilyHub Features Map to Task Management Platform Capabilities

The Task Management Platform provides robust task coordination infrastructure. FamilyHub doesn't require custom programming—it reconfigures and reframes existing capabilities through family-friendly design.

#### Task Management → Chore and Activity Coordination

**Platform capability:** CRUD operations for tasks with assignment, due dates, priorities, status tracking, and project organization.

**FamilyHub mapping:**

- Task = **Chore** or **Activity** (depending on context)
- Standard task fields (title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, project) remain at database level
- Additional metadata for family context:
  - `family_member_id` (which person/color is this assigned to)
  - `recurrence_pattern` (daily chores, weekly activities)
  - `shared_task` (boolean: requires multiple people)
  - `conflict_detected` (scheduling overlap warning)
  - `visibility_level` (everyone sees, or specific family members only)

**Design implications:**

- Every task display must show WHO it's assigned to (color-coding essential)
- Priority language shifts from "high/medium/low" to "urgent/soon/when you can"
- Status language shifts from corporate ("in progress") to family-friendly ("started," "done")
- Task creation should feel quick and visual (big buttons, color selection, minimal typing)

#### Project Organization → Family Members or Categories

**Platform capability:** Projects group related tasks with hierarchical organization, visual customization (color, icon), and progress tracking.

**FamilyHub mapping:**

- Projects can represent **Family Members** (Mom's tasks, Child 1's tasks) OR **Categories** (House, School, Activities)
- Configuration choice: Let families decide their organizational preference
- Each project tagged with:
  - `project_type` (person, category, or hybrid)
  - `color` (matches family member's pin color or category theme)
  - `icon` (profile photo for people, symbol for categories)

**Design implications:**

- Project selector must accommodate both organizational styles visually
- Family member projects use warm, personal imagery (photos, avatars)
- Category projects use friendly icons (house, backpack, soccer ball)
- Project colors must be distinct enough for at-a-glance recognition
- Progress visualization: "5 out of 8 chores done today" feels encouraging

#### Priority System → Family-Friendly Urgency

**Platform capability:** Three-tier priority system (low, medium, high) affects sorting and visual emphasis.

**FamilyHub mapping:**

- Priority renamed for family context:
  - Low → **"When You Can"** (no rush)
  - Medium → **"This Week"** (normal priority)
  - High → **"Today"** or **"Urgent"** (needs attention now)
- Priority affects visual weight but doesn't feel punitive

**Design implications:**

- Priority indicators should be gentle, not alarming (no angry red!)
- Visual language: size variation, color saturation, or icon badges
- "Urgent" tasks stand out but don't induce panic (helpful, not stressful)
- Kids need to understand priority at a glance (visual > text)

#### Status Tracking → Progress Celebration

**Platform capability:** Task status transitions (To Do, In Progress, Complete, Archived) with timestamp tracking.

**FamilyHub mapping:**

- Status renamed for family motivation:
  - To Do → **"Not Started"** or just the task itself
  - In Progress → **"Working On It"** or **"Started"**
  - Complete → **"Done!"** with optional celebration animation
  - Archived → Hidden from main view (clutter reduction)
- Status transitions feel rewarding, especially for kids

**Design implications:**

- Status change interactions should feel satisfying (checkmark animation, sound effect)
- Completed tasks visually distinct but still visible (strikethrough, dimmed, moved to bottom)
- Progress bars for multi-step tasks or daily chore completion
- "Done" state celebrates accomplishment (green check, small animation, encouraging text)

#### Conflict Detection → Schedule Harmony

**Platform capability (platform-specific feature):** Algorithmic detection of overlapping due dates/times, assignment overload warnings.

**FamilyHub implementation:**

- Detects when same person assigned to multiple tasks at same time
- Warns when day has too many commitments scheduled
- Identifies impossible logistics (two kids need pickup at same time, different locations)
- Gentle, helpful alerts—not judgmental

**Design implications:**

- Conflict warnings must be noticeable but not alarming
- Visual language: amber/orange caution (not red danger)
- Notification text: "Looks like Emma and Jake both have practice at 4pm. Want to adjust?"
- Month view should visually show "density" (light days vs. packed days)
- Warnings appear on both display board and mobile app

#### Recurring Tasks → Routine Automation

**Platform capability:** Task recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, custom intervals) with automatic regeneration.

**FamilyHub mapping:**

- Recurring tasks = **Daily Chores** or **Weekly Activities**
- Common patterns pre-configured: every day, every weekday, every Saturday, etc.
- Visual distinction for one-time vs. recurring tasks

**Design implications:**

- Recurring tasks need clear visual indicator (circular arrow icon, "repeats" badge)
- Task creation: simple toggle "Does this repeat?" with pattern selector
- Calendar view shows recurring pattern (not cluttered with individual instances)
- Ability to "skip this week" without deleting the pattern

#### Real-Time Sync → Instant Visibility

**Platform capability:** Database updates trigger real-time synchronization across all connected devices.

**FamilyHub implementation:**

- Physical display board updates instantly when task added/changed via app
- Mobile app updates instantly when task added/changed on display board
- Visual feedback confirms sync (brief highlight, "saved" indicator)

**Design implications:**

- Loading states must be fast (sync should feel instantaneous)
- Offline mode gracefully handled (changes sync when connection restored)
- Visual confirmation that sync occurred (subtle animation, timestamp update)
- No confusing "refresh" buttons—it should just work

## 5.2 Database Entity Alignment

### How Task Management Platform Database Supports FamilyHub

The platform uses a relational database schema. FamilyHub extends base entities with family-specific context fields.

#### Users → Family Members

**Base entity:** User authentication, profile data, workspace membership.

**FamilyHub extensions:**

- Additional profile fields:
  - `display_name` (what kids call them: "Mom," "Dad," "Emma")
  - `color` (hex code for their assigned color: red, blue, green, yellow)
  - `pin_color_id` (links to physical NFC pin)
  - `age_group` (adult, teen, child—affects UI complexity shown to them)
  - `avatar_url` (profile photo displayed on board and app)
  - `notification_preferences` (how much they want to be reminded)

**Design implications:**

- User profiles feel personal, not corporate (friendly photos, nicknames okay)
- Color assignment happens during setup (color picker interface)
- Profile editing should be accessible to kids (not just admins/parents)
- Visual representation: avatar + color combination = instant recognition

#### Workspaces → Households

**Base entity:** Team/organization container for multi-user collaboration.

**FamilyHub terminology:**

- Workspace → **Household** or **Family**
- No structural changes required
- One household = one family unit (could be extended family, blended family, etc.)

**Design implications:**

- Household setup wizard: "Add Your Family Members" not "Create Workspace"
- Household settings accessible to adults, simplified for kids
- Household name optional ("The Johnsons" or just "Our Family")

#### Projects → Family Members or Categories

**Base entity:** Task organizational containers with name, description, color, icon, status.

**FamilyHub flexibility:**

- Projects represent either **People** or **Categories** (user choice)
- Person-based: "Mom," "Dad," "Emma," "Jake"
- Category-based: "House Chores," "School," "Activities," "Errands"
- Hybrid: Combination of both
- Additional fields:
  - `project_type` (person, category)
  - `family_member_id` (if person-based, links to user)
  - `default_assignee` (if category-based, who usually does these tasks)

**Design implications:**

- Setup wizard asks: "How do you want to organize? By person or by type?"
- Project creation interface adapts based on choice
- Visual representation: person projects show avatars, category projects show icons
- Easy to switch organizational style later without losing data

#### Tasks → Chores and Activities

**Base entity:** Task with title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, project association.

**FamilyHub extensions:**

- Additional fields:
  - `recurrence_pattern` (daily, weekly, custom)
  - `shared_task` (boolean: multiple people required)
  - `estimated_duration` (helps with scheduling)
  - `conflict_warning` (boolean: overlaps with other commitments)
  - `completion_celebration` (optional: special encouragement for kids)
  - `attachment_urls` (photos, notes, links)
- Terminology variants:
  - Chore: household task (clean room, take out trash)
  - Activity: scheduled event (soccer practice, dentist appointment)
  - Errand: out-of-house task (grocery shopping, pickup)

**Design implications:**

- Task creation form should feel fast (minimal required fields)
- Visual distinction between chores, activities, errands (subtle icon difference)
- Due date/time picker family-friendly (big calendar, simple time selection)
- Assignment via color selection (tap the person's color)
- Shared tasks show multiple avatars/colors

#### Notifications → Helpful Reminders

**Base entity:** Notification system for task assignments, due dates, status changes.

**FamilyHub adaptation:**

- Notification tone: encouraging, not nagging
- Example notifications:
  - "Emma, your room cleaning is due today! You've got this."
  - "Reminder: Soccer practice at 4pm. Mom is picking up."
  - "Great job, Jake! You finished your homework early."
- Notification timing configurable per family member
- Visual notifications on display board + push notifications on phones

**Design implications:**

- Notification design must work for both kids and adults
- Tone: supportive coach, not demanding boss
- Visual: friendly icon, readable text, dismissible but not ignorable
- Celebrate completions, not just remind about pending tasks

```

#### How Developers Use This Configuration

**Terminology replacement throughout application:**

```python
# Example Flask template using configuration
from config import get_brand_config

config = get_brand_config('familyhub')

# In template:
<h1>{{ config.terminology.task_plural }}</h1>
# Renders: <h1>Tasks</h1>

# Or context-specific:
<h1>{{ config.terminology.chore_plural }}</h1>
# Renders: <h1>Chores</h1>
```

**Color theming via CSS variables:**

```css
/* Generated from FamilyHub configuration */
:root {
  --color-primary: #4A90E2;
  --color-secondary: #F5A623;
  --color-accent: #7ED321;

  --color-priority-low: #95A5A6;
  --color-priority-medium: #F39C12;
  --color-priority-high: #E67E22;

  --color-status-complete: #27AE60;

  --font-heading: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  --font-body: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

.task-item.high-priority {
  border-left: 4px solid var(--color-priority-high);
}

.task-complete {
  color: var(--color-status-complete);
}
```

**Notification message generation:**

```javascript
// Example React component using configuration
import brandConfig from '@/config/brands/familyhub.json';

function TaskCompletionNotification({ assigneeName, taskTitle }) {
  const message = brandConfig.notification_messages.task_completed;
  const phrase = brandConfig.encouragement_phrases.on_completion[
    Math.floor(Math.random() * brandConfig.encouragement_phrases.on_completion.length)
  ];

  return (
    <div className="notification success">
      <h3>{phrase}</h3>
      <p>{message.body
        .replace('{assignee_name}', assigneeName)
        .replace('{task_title}', taskTitle)}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Component Library Expectations

Developers benefit from a **design system** documenting reusable components. FamilyHub component library should include:

**Core Components:**

1. **Buttons**
   - Primary (main actions: "Add Task")
   - Secondary (neutral actions: "Cancel")
   - Success (completion: "Mark Done")
   - Sizes: small, medium, large
   - States: default, hover, active, disabled

2. **Task Cards**
   - Task card (individual task display)
   - Shared task card (multiple family members)
   - Recurring task card (repeating indicator)
   - Overdue task card (gentle reminder styling)
   - Completed task card (celebration state)

3. **Family Member Indicators**
   - Avatar + color combination
   - Color badge alone
   - Multi-member display (shared tasks)
   - Assignment selector (pick family member)

4. **Notifications/Alerts**
   - Reminder notification (gentle, supportive)
   - Conflict warning (helpful, problem-solving)
   - Completion celebration (encouraging, positive)
   - Daily summary (motivational)

5. **Form Elements**
   - Task creation form (quick-add version)
   - Task creation form (detailed version)
   - Family member selector (color-coded)
   - Date/time picker (family-friendly)
   - Priority selector (visual, not just text)
   - Recurrence pattern selector

6. **Calendar & Timeline Views**
   - Month calendar (density indicators)
   - Week view (detailed schedule)
   - Today view (focused task list)
   - Timeline (upcoming deadlines)

7. **Progress Visualizations**
   - Task completion percentage (family member or category)
   - Daily progress indicator ("3 of 5 tasks done")
   - Week overview (days with checkmarks)

**Component Documentation Format:**

Each component documented with:

- **Visual example** (screenshot or live preview)
- **Usage guidelines** (when to use this component)
- **Anatomy** (labeled diagram of component parts)
- **Specifications** (dimensions, spacing, typography, colors)
- **States** (default, hover, active, disabled, error, success)
- **Responsive behavior** (mobile vs. tablet vs. desktop vs. display board)
- **Accessibility notes** (readable by kids and adults, touch-friendly)

**Delivery format options:**

- **Figma component library** (preferred for web-based handoff)
- **Adobe XD component library** (if Adobe workflow)
- **PDF design system documentation** (static reference)

#### Handoff Tools and Process

**Recommended handoff platforms:**

1. **Figma (preferred):**
   - Share link to Figma file with developer permissions
   - Use Figma Inspect mode for CSS extraction
   - Organize frames by screen/component
   - Include annotations for interactions (task assignment flow, completion celebration)
   - Export assets directly from Figma

2. **Zeplin:**
   - Upload designs from Figma/Sketch
   - Automatic CSS generation
   - Asset export in multiple formats
   - Comment and annotation tools

**Handoff checklist:**

- [ ] All screens designed at standard breakpoints (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1440px, display board 1200x1600px portrait)
- [ ] Interactive states documented (hover, focus, active, disabled, complete)
- [ ] Color-coding system clear (family member colors, priority colors, status colors)
- [ ] Typography specs complete (family-friendly readability)
- [ ] Icons exported as SVG with proper naming
- [ ] Logos exported in multiple formats
- [ ] Component library documented
- [ ] Kids mode variations shown (larger text, simplified options)
- [ ] Physical board interface mockups provided
- [ ] Celebration animations described (or simple animation samples)

**Communication protocol:**

- **Week 2:** Initial design direction shared (mood boards, color explorations, family member color palette)

## 5.5 API Integration Points

### Where Design Touches Code: UI Components and Data Requirements

FamilyHub interface components consume data from backend APIs. Understanding these integration points helps designers create realistic, implementable interfaces.

#### Dashboard Components and Data Requirements

**Family Dashboard:** Primary landing page showing household task status.

**Components:**

1. **Today's Tasks Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/tasks/today?household_id={id}`
   - **Response:** `{ tasks: [{ id, title, assignee_name, assignee_color, priority, status, due_time }] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when tasks added/completed
   - **Design considerations:** Color-coded by assignee, sortable by time, quick "mark done" action

2. **Upcoming Week Preview**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/tasks/upcoming?days=7`
   - **Response:** Array of tasks grouped by day
   - **Update frequency:** Hourly or on task changes
   - **Design considerations:** Visual density indicator (light vs. busy days), scroll or expand days

3. **Family Members Progress**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/household/{id}/member-progress`
   - **Response:** `{ members: [{ name, color, tasks_total, tasks_complete, completion_percentage }] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time on task completion
   - **Design considerations:** Progress bars per member, celebratory when 100%, encouraging when low

4. **Conflict Warnings**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/conflicts/active`
   - **Response:** Array of scheduling conflicts with descriptions
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when tasks scheduled
   - **Design considerations:** Amber/orange alert styling, actionable ("Reschedule" button), dismissible

5. **Calendar Preview (Month View)**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/calendar/month?year=2025&month=4`
   - **Response:** Calendar grid with task counts per day, color-coded by family member
   - **Update frequency:** On task date changes
   - **Design considerations:** Density visualization (1-2 tasks: light, 3-5: medium, 6+: busy), tap day to see details

**Loading states:** All dashboard components must handle:

- Initial load (skeleton screens or friendly loading animation)
- Empty state (encouraging message: "No tasks yet today! Add one below.")
- Error state ("Couldn't load tasks right now. We'll keep trying.")

#### Task Creation and Assignment UI

**Quick-add task form:** Fast task creation from any view.

**API endpoint:** `POST /api/tasks`

- **Validation:** Real-time feedback (empty title shows gentle prompt)
- **Submission:** Large, friendly "Add Task" button
- **Feedback:** Success message with assignee confirmation, brief celebration if it's a kid

#### Task Completion Interaction

**Marking tasks complete:** Critical satisfaction moment.

**API endpoint:** `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete`

**Request:** `{ "completed": true }`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "task_id": 142,
  "status": "complete",
  "completed_by": "Emma",

# PART 6: CROSS-DISCIPLINE WORKFLOW

*This section explains how design and programming students collaborate throughout the semester.*

-----

## Overview: How Design and Development Teams Work Together

FamilyHub succeeds through coordinated effort between design students (creating brand identity and user experience) and programming students (building the Task Management Platform). Neither discipline works in isolation—designers need technical constraints, developers need visual specifications.

The collaboration teaches real-world interdisciplinary communication while producing better outcomes for both groups.

-----

## Sprint-by-Sprint Collaboration Touchpoints

## Maintaining Professional Yet Warm Collaboration Tone

FamilyHub is a genuine, helpful product for real families—not a satirical corporate tool like TeamFlow™. Collaboration should reflect this warmth while maintaining professionalism.

**Example email exchanges:**

**From designer to developer:**

> Subject: FamilyHub Dashboard Widget Question
>
> Hi [Developer Name],
>
> I'm working on the FamilyHub dashboard design and have a few questions about what's technically possible:
>
> 1. Can we show family member progress bars that update in real-time as tasks are completed?
> 2. For the conflict detection widget, how many conflicts can we display without cluttering the dashboard?
> 3. Is it possible to have different dashboard layouts for parents vs. kids (simplified view for children)?
>
> I want to make sure my designs are realistic and implementable! Let me know what works best from a technical standpoint.
>
> Thanks!
> [Designer Name]

**From developer to designer:**

> Subject: RE: FamilyHub Dashboard Widget Question
>
> Hi [Designer Name],
>
> Great questions! Here's what's possible:
>
> 1. Yes, we can update progress bars in real-time. The database tracks task completions and recalculates progress automatically.
> 2. We can display up to 5 active conflicts comfortably. If more exist, we could show "5+ conflicts detected" with a link to view all.
> 3. Different layouts for parents vs. kids is definitely possible through configuration. We could use a "kids mode" toggle that simplifies the interface.
>
> Attached is an updated ERD showing how family member progress is calculated. Let me know if you need clarification on anything!
>
> Best,
> [Developer Name]

**Tone in collaboration:**

- Friendly and supportive (this is a family product—warmth is authentic)
- Curious and collaborative (both disciplines learning from each other)
- Respectful of constraints (designers respect technical limits, developers respect creative vision)
- Problem-solving focused (finding solutions together)

**When to be more formal:**

- Asset delivery deadlines
- Technical limitations that block design implementation
- Accessibility requirements
- Any safety or inclusion concerns (family product serves diverse households)
