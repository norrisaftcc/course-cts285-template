-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

You are creating a complete brand identity and marketing campaign for **StudyStream**, a physical + digital task management system designed specifically for college students managing multiple courses, group projects, work schedules, and personal commitments.

Your programming team partners are building the software platform. Your job is to create the brand that makes this product appealing, trustworthy, and essential for students drowning in syllabi, Canvas notifications, and group chat chaos.

### Target Audience

**Primary:** College students ages 18-25 attending 2-year or 4-year programs

**Demographics:**

- Mix of traditional students (straight from high school) and non-traditional students (working adults returning to school)
- 60% work part-time (15-25 hours/week), 25% work full-time while attending school
- Living situations vary: dorms, off-campus apartments, with parents
- Income: Limited. Spending own money or financial aid funds
- Tech-savvy but overwhelmed by too many platforms

**Psychographics:**

- Motivated but constantly stressed about missing deadlines
- Frustrated by information scattered across multiple systems per class (Canvas, email, GroupMe, Google Docs, professor websites)
- Anxious about group projects where nobody knows who’s responsible for what
- Seeking control and clarity, not another app that nags them
- Value peer recommendations over corporate marketing
- Want to feel capable, not judged for struggling

**Current Behavior:**

- Use phone calendars, planners, sticky notes, or “just remember it”
- Check Canvas/LMS multiple times daily out of anxiety
- Screenshot assignment due dates
- Rely on friends to remind them
- Pull all-nighters because they forgot something was due
- Miss points on group projects due to miscommunication

**What They’re Looking For:**

- ONE place to see everything across all classes
- Visibility into group project task division
- Reduced anxiety about “did I forget something?”
- Something that doesn’t feel like homework to maintain
- A system that works when life gets chaotic (finals, work schedule changes, family emergencies)

### Company Background

**StudyStream** was founded in 2023 by Maya Chen, a recent computer science graduate who nearly failed her senior capstone course despite being a strong student. The problem wasn’t the coursework—it was managing five classes simultaneously, each with different assignment platforms, group project tools, and communication methods, while working 20 hours a week at the campus library.

During finals week of her senior year, Maya realized she’d completely forgotten about a major group presentation worth 25% of her grade. Her group mates had assumed she was working on her section. She wasn’t. The experience was humiliating and almost cost her graduation.

Maya spent the summer after graduation prototyping a system that combined the tactile satisfaction of a physical planner with the smart notifications of digital tools. She wanted something that could sit on a desk or mount on a dorm wall—visible, tangible, and impossible to ignore like a phone notification. After beta testing with her former roommates (still in school), she launched StudyStream.

The company’s mission: **Reduce academic anxiety by creating clarity, not adding complexity.**

Maya’s personal philosophy drives the brand: “You’re not failing at college because you’re disorganized. You’re overwhelmed because colleges make you manage six different platforms per class while expecting you to work, sleep, and have a life. That’s not a you problem. That’s a systems problem.”

### Brand Personality

StudyStream is the supportive, organized friend who doesn’t judge you for being stressed.

**Brand Voice:**

- Encouraging without toxic positivity
- Practical and honest about student struggles
- Peer-to-peer, never talking down
- “We get it” energy—doesn’t pretend college is easy
- Confident but not corporate

**Visual Identity Direction (your job to develop):**

- Should feel energetic but calming
- Organized without being rigid or corporate
- Modern but accessible (not trendy, not sterile)
- Appeals across genders and majors
- Trustworthy enough for parents to buy as gifts

**Not This:**

- Corporate productivity culture (“optimize your life!”)
- Minimalist tech company aesthetic (too cold)
- Bullet journal aesthetic (too craft-y, too much work)
- Generic academic branding (boring, institutional)

### Campaign Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Position StudyStream as the solution to academic overwhelm for college students who are tired of juggling multiple platforms and constant anxiety about missing deadlines.

**What Your Design Should Accomplish:**

1. **Build Trust Fast**
- Students are skeptical of “productivity solutions” that create more work
- Your branding must communicate: “This actually makes life easier”
- Founder story matters—this was built by someone who gets it
1. **Differentiate from Apps**
- There are hundreds of task apps
- StudyStream is physical + digital = always visible, harder to ignore
- Show why tangible matters for students living in small spaces
1. **Address the Anxiety**
- Academic anxiety is real and pervasive
- Your messaging should acknowledge stress without dwelling on it
- Focus on relief: “Finally see everything in one place”
1. **Appeal to Gift-Givers**
- Parents, grandparents, relatives buy back-to-school gifts
- Packaging must work as a gift
- Messaging must resonate with adults who want to help students succeed
1. **Create Peer Buzz**
- Students trust other students
- Visual identity must be shareable (Instagram, TikTok)
- “I need to show my roommate this” energy

### Brand Positioning

**Position:** The academic command center that reduces stress by making everything visible.

**Key Messages:**

*For Students:*

- “Stop wondering what you’re forgetting”
- “See all your classes in one place—on your wall and in your pocket”
- “Group projects where everyone actually knows what they’re doing”
- “Made by a student who almost didn’t graduate because of organization chaos”

*For Gift-Givers (Parents/Family):*

- “Help them succeed without adding more stress”
- “Supports academic success for students juggling work and school”
- “From scattered to sorted—a system that actually gets used”

**What StudyStream Is NOT:**

- Not another productivity app that gets abandoned after a week
- Not a “try harder, be better” motivational system
- Not complicated to set up or maintain
- Not corporate productivity culture applied to students

### Required Deliverables

Your campaign must include:

**Required (not choices):**

1. **Logo & Brand Identity System**

## PART 2: PRODUCT DEEP DIVE

### What StudyStream Is

StudyStream is a **hybrid physical-digital task management system** designed specifically for college students juggling multiple classes, group projects, work schedules, and personal commitments. It combines a **wall-mounted or desk-standing interactive display board** with a **synchronized mobile/web app**, creating a system that’s always visible at home and always accessible on the go.

### Physical & Digital Components

**Interactive Display Board:**

- 18” × 24” digital display (landscape or portrait)
- Wall-mounted (dorm-safe) or desk stand
- Touchscreen with stylus input
- E-ink technology (no glare, low power, readable in any lighting)
- Real-time sync with app

**Smart Colored Pins:**

- 8 color-coded magnetic pins representing classes
- Tag assignments to classes for visual organization
- See at a glance which classes have heavy workload

**Mobile & Web Apps:**

- Full access to all assignments and tasks
- Syllabus scanning (OCR technology extracts due dates)
- Share group project task lists via link (no account needed for teammates)
- Cloud sync across all devices

### Core Features

**Individual Course Management:**

- Assignment tracking (title, due date/time, estimated hours, completion status)
- Class organization (color-coded by class)
- Priority flagging for high-stakes assignments
- Recurring tasks (weekly readings, discussion posts)
- Task breakdown (large projects → subtasks → milestones)
- Time-blocking (schedule specific work sessions)
- Progress states (not started / in progress / complete)
- Attachment links (Canvas, Google Docs, PDFs)

**Group Project Collaboration:**

- Shared task lists accessible via link (teammates don’t need StudyStream)
- Task assignment with visible ownership
- Progress tracking (see what teammates completed)
- Study group scheduling (find mutual availability)
- Deadline coordination

**Proactive Management:**

- Conflict detection (warns about multiple deadlines same day)
- Visual workload density (color-coded week intensity: green/yellow/red)
- Overload alerts (flags unsustainable weeks in advance)
- Time-block reminders
- Customizable notifications

**View Modes:**

- Today, Week, Month Calendar, By Class, Group Projects, Time-Block

### Why This Matters for Students

**The Current Problem:**

College students manage 4-6 classes simultaneously, each with its own LMS page, communication style, and assignment system. Add work schedules and personal commitments, and you’re tracking 50-100+ deadline items across fragmented platforms: Canvas (checked obsessively out of anxiety), email announcements, physical syllabi (often lost), group text chains, shared Google Docs, phone calendars.

What breaks: assignments fall through cracks, group projects suffer from “I thought you were doing that” confusion, students don’t realize a week is overloaded until they’re drowning in it, large projects feel paralyzing with no clear starting point.

**How StudyStream Addresses This:**

**Visibility Without Effort:** The display board is always visible in your living space—no opening apps, no checking five different platforms. You see your complete workload every time you’re home. The mobile app travels with you to class, work, and the library.

**Proactive, Not Reactive:** Unlike LMS calendars that require you to remember to check them, StudyStream warns you two weeks in advance that you have three exams and a lab report due within 48 hours. Visual density warnings show overloaded weeks before you’re in them.

**Whole-Life Integration:** LMS calendars only know academic deadlines. StudyStream integrates work shifts, study sessions, personal commitments—one system for everything students juggle, not separate calendars fighting for attention.

**Executive Function Support:** Task breakdown transforms “write research paper” (paralyzing) into “choose topic” → “find 5 sources” → “create outline” (manageable). Time-blocking connects deadlines to actual scheduled work time, preventing “I have a week” time-blindness.

**Group Project Clarity:** Shared task lists with visible ownership eliminate “who’s doing what?” confusion. Teammates see responsibilities and progress without StudyStream accounts. No more being the “group mom” sending reminder texts.

**Different from Canvas:** StudyStream doesn’t replace your LMS—it fills the gaps. Canvas is where assignments live institutionally; StudyStream is where you actually manage your life. It’s proactive (warns about conflicts), integrated (work + school + life), supportive (breaks down overwhelming projects), and ambient (always visible, reduces anxiety).

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### User Story 1: Emma—The Overcommitted Student

**Background:**
Emma is a 20-year-old junior at a state university majoring in biology (pre-med track). She’s taking 16 credit hours this semester including Organic Chemistry II, Physics, and two lab courses. She works 15 hours per week as a peer tutor in the campus writing center and volunteers 4 hours per week at the university hospital. She lives in a shared apartment with two roommates.

**Current System:**
Emma uses her iPhone calendar for due dates and keeps a paper planner for weekly to-do lists. She has Canvas open on her laptop “basically always” and checks it multiple times per day because she’s terrified of missing assignment updates. She screenshots syllabi and stores them in a phone folder. She uses GroupMe for group project communication and Google Docs for collaborative work.

**Pain Points:**

- She’s constantly anxious that she’s forgetting something
- Wednesday of Week 7 this semester, she discovered she had three major exams and a lab report due within two days—she’d entered the dates separately but never saw them together
- Her Organic Chemistry professor posts assignments to Canvas sporadically, so she checks obsessively
- Group projects are chaotic: “I’m always the person asking ‘who’s doing what?’ and everyone’s like ‘I thought you were handling that’”
- She’s missed points twice this semester on assignments because Canvas notifications got buried

**Quote:**
*“I spend more energy worrying about whether I’m forgetting something than I spend actually doing the work. I just want to see everything in one place and know I’m not missing anything. I’m not disorganized—I’m just juggling too many platforms.”*

**How StudyStream Helps:**

- Display board mounted above her desk shows all upcoming deadlines across all classes—she sees workload density at a glance
- Conflict detection would have warned her about Week 7 overload two weeks in advance
- Shared group project task lists eliminate “who’s doing what” confusion
- One system to check instead of five different platforms reduces anxiety
- Time-blocking helps her schedule tutoring work around heavy study weeks

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **reduced anxiety** and **one-stop clarity**. Emma doesn’t need motivation—she needs a system that makes her feel in control. Visual metaphors of “seeing everything” and “nothing falls through the cracks” will resonate.

### User Story 2: Marcus—The Working Student

**Background:**
Marcus is a 23-year-old community college student taking 12 credit hours while working 32 hours per week as a shift supervisor at Target. He’s pursuing an associate degree in business administration and plans to transfer to a four-year university. He’s a first-generation college student living with his parents to save money. His work schedule changes weekly, and he often picks up extra shifts.

**Current System:**
Marcus uses his phone’s reminders app and keeps a small notebook in his work backpack. He admits he “just tries to remember” most assignment due dates. He doesn’t use Canvas much except to submit work—he finds the interface confusing and time-consuming to navigate. He’s missed several discussion board deadlines this semester because they weren’t on the syllabus and he didn’t check Canvas announcements.

**Pain Points:**

- Work schedule changes make planning difficult—he can’t commit to study times in advance
- He forgets about assignments until the night before (or after) they’re due
- Discussion boards are his nemesis: “I don’t even know they exist until I get an email saying I missed one”
- Group projects are nearly impossible: his classmates schedule meetings during his work shifts
- He feels like he’s constantly playing catch-up, never ahead

**Quote:**
*“I’m working 30+ hours a week to pay for school, and my professors act like Canvas is my full-time job. I don’t have time to log in every day and hunt for new assignments. I just need something that tells me what’s due and when so I can plan around my work schedule.”*

**How StudyStream Helps:**

- Quick-add assignments from phone during breaks at work
- Display board at home shows what needs attention when he has free time
- Week view helps him see if he needs to skip an extra shift to handle heavy workload
- Mobile access means he can check/update anywhere between work and school
- Syllabus scanning feature catches those hidden discussion board assignments
- Time-blocking lets him schedule study sessions around work shifts
- Study group coordination tool helps find meeting times that work with his Target schedule

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must work for students with **limited time and mental bandwidth**. Marcus isn’t lazy—he’s exhausted. Messaging around “simple,” “fast setup,” and “works with your life, not against it” will resonate. Visual identity should feel accessible, not overwhelming with features.

-----

### User Story 3: Aisha—The Group Project Leader (By Default)

**Background:**
Aisha is a 21-year-old senior majoring in communications at a mid-sized private university. She’s taking 15 credit hours, interning 10 hours per week at a local PR firm, and is involved in two campus organizations. She’s naturally organized and often ends up as the “project manager” for group assignments because no one else takes initiative. She lives in an on-campus apartment with three friends.

**Current System:**
Aisha uses Google Calendar for her personal deadlines, a Notion workspace for her internship tasks, and creates shared Google Docs for every group project with task checklists and deadlines. She sends reminder texts to group members and often does other people’s sections when they don’t follow through. She’s organized but frustrated by having to manage everyone else’s accountability.

**Pain Points:**

- She spends more time managing group coordination than doing her own work
- Groupmates say “I didn’t know I was supposed to do that” even when it’s written in the shared doc
- People don’t check the Google Doc, so she ends up texting everyone individually
- She can’t tell if someone is actually working on their part or just saying they will
- She’s burned out from being the default “responsible one” and resents her classmates

**Quote:**
*“I’m so tired of being the group mom. I shouldn’t have to text five people individually to remind them what they agreed to do. I want a system where everyone can see what they’re responsible for and I can see progress without nagging. If they don’t do it, at least the professor will see it wasn’t me.”*

**How StudyStream Helps:**

- Shared group project task lists with visible ownership (everyone sees who has what)
- Progress tracking shows what’s complete and what’s not—transparency without nagging
- Teammates without StudyStream can still access shared project via link
- Aisha can assign tasks, set deadlines, and see status without texting everyone
- When someone doesn’t complete their task, there’s a record (accountability)
- Task breakdown helps divide large projects into clear, assignable steps
- Study group scheduling finds mutual availability without endless GroupMe threads

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must speak to **collaboration clarity** and **accountability without confrontation**. Aisha doesn’t want to be the bad guy—she wants a system that makes responsibilities obvious. Messaging around “everyone on the same page” and “no more guessing who’s doing what” will resonate. Visual identity should feel mature and professional, not casual or playful.

### User Story 4: Jordan—The Neurodivergent Student

**Background:**
Jordan is a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in computer science at a large public university. They have ADHD (diagnosed in high school) and take medication, but still struggle with executive function, time blindness, and task initiation. They’re a strong student when they’re engaged, but they hyperfocus on interesting projects and forget about “boring” assignments until deadlines pass. They live in a residence hall and often study in their room because the library is overwhelming.

**Current System:**
Jordan tries to use phone reminders but dismisses notifications without processing them. They’ve tried bullet journaling (too much maintenance), phone apps (out of sight, out of mind), and sticky notes (lose them or stop seeing them). They rely heavily on Canvas due date notifications but often don’t start work until deadlines pass. They’ve tried creating assignment schedules but can’t estimate how long tasks take, so plans fall apart. Their biggest struggle is starting work on assignments that feel overwhelming—they don’t know where to begin, so they avoid starting until panic sets in.

**Pain Points:**

- Time blindness: “due next week” feels like infinite time until suddenly it’s tomorrow
- Task initiation paralysis on large projects (research papers, presentations)
- Notifications get dismissed without action (“I’ll do it later” → forgets completely)
- Can’t break large assignments into smaller steps independently
- Hyperfocus on interesting work means “boring” deadlines get missed
- Physical planners become invisible after a few days (brain stops seeing them)

**Quote:**
*“My brain doesn’t do ‘future.’ If I can’t see it right now, it doesn’t exist. And if a project feels too big, I just… freeze. I’ll stare at ‘write research paper’ for 20 minutes and then go play video games because at least I know how to do that. I need something that shows me what to do FIRST, not just when it’s due.”*

**How StudyStream Helps:**

- Physical display board stays visible (harder to ignore than phone notifications)
- Task breakdown feature: “Write research paper” → “Choose topic” → “Find 5 sources” → “Create outline” → smaller, manageable steps
- Time-blocking: Schedule specific work sessions (“Research sources: Tuesday 3-4pm”)
- Progress states show momentum (“I’ve started 3/8 subtasks—I’m making progress”)
- Visual density warnings help with time blindness (see workload intensity ahead of time)
- Tactile interaction (stylus, pins) = satisfying physical engagement that digital-only lacks
- Time-block reminders provide external structure for task initiation

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **executive function support** without pathologizing or talking down to neurodivergent students. Many students struggle with task initiation and time management—it’s not just ADHD. Messaging around “break it down,” “see your progress,” and “always visible” will resonate. Visual identity should feel structured but not rigid, organized but not sterile.

## Current Behaviors & Why Existing Solutions Fail

**What Students Currently Use:**

1. **Phone Calendar Apps (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar)**
- **Why it fails:** Out of sight, out of mind. Notifications get dismissed. Requires active checking. Doesn’t show workload density or conflicts proactively. Can’t break tasks into steps. No time-blocking for actual work sessions.
1. **LMS Built-in Calendars (Canvas, Blackboard)**
- **Why it fails:** Only shows academic deadlines, not work/life commitments. Requires logging in. Interface varies by professor’s setup. Students don’t trust it because professors don’t always use it consistently. Shows WHEN things are due, not WHEN to do the work. Can’t coordinate group project task division.
1. **Paper Planners**
- **Why it fails:** Gets left in backpack. Requires manual entry of every assignment. No alerts or reminders. Can’t share with group members. Rigid structure doesn’t adapt to changing schedules. No way to break down large projects visually.
1. **Productivity Apps (Notion, Todoist, Asana)**
- **Why it fails:** Steep learning curve. Requires setup and maintenance. Too many features create decision paralysis. Feels like another homework assignment to maintain. No physical presence. Built for professionals, not students juggling multiple courses with different systems.
1. **Sticky Notes / Whiteboards**
- **Why it fails:** Static—no reminders or sync. Gets messy fast. Can’t access away from home. Sticky notes fall off or become invisible background. No conflict detection. Can’t share with study groups or project teams.
1. **“Just Remembering”**
- **Why it fails:** Human memory is unreliable under stress. Works until it doesn’t (then fails catastrophically). Creates constant anxiety. No backup system. Large projects feel overwhelming with no breakdown structure.
1. **Group Text Chains + Shared Google Docs**
- **Why it fails:** Information scattered. People don’t check docs. Text reminders feel like nagging. No accountability tracking. Requires one person to project-manage everyone else. Can’t coordinate schedules for study sessions efficiently.

**The Pattern:**
Digital solutions lack physical presence (get ignored). Physical solutions lack smart features (no reminders, no sync). Nothing bridges the gap. Nothing is designed specifically for students juggling multiple courses with different organizational systems while also managing work and life. Nothing helps break overwhelming projects into manageable steps. Nothing connects deadlines to scheduled work time.

**What Students Actually Need:**
A system that’s **always visible** (can’t ignore), **always accessible** (mobile), **proactively helpful** (warns about conflicts), **collaboration-ready** (group projects + study groups), **executive-function supportive** (breaks down tasks, schedules work time), and **designed for their specific chaos** (multiple courses, work schedules, scattered information sources).

## PART 4: STRATEGIC GUIDANCE

### Print Deliverables Strategic Questions

You must choose **two (2) print deliverables** from the options provided. Don’t default to obvious choices—think strategically about where StudyStream needs to show up to reach students and gift-givers.

**Before You Choose, Research:**

- Where do college students encounter print materials during back-to-school season?
- Where do parents shop for college student gifts?
- What print pieces would students actually keep vs. immediately recycle?
- How can print extend beyond traditional advertising to create utility or collectability?

**Strategic Questions to Guide Your Choices:**

**About Point-of-Sale:**

- Where would StudyStream be sold? (Campus bookstores? Target? Best Buy? Online only?)
- If selling in retail environments, what print materials support the purchase decision at that location?
- What do competing productivity products use at point-of-sale? How can you differentiate?

**About Gifting:**

- If this is often purchased as a gift, what print materials help gift-givers understand the value?
- Do you need something that explains features to a parent who isn’t the end user?
- Should any print deliverable live INSIDE the packaging as a “gift message” option?

**About Student Spaces:**

- Dorm rooms, apartments, campus libraries, coffee shops, study spaces—where do students see print?
- What format would students voluntarily display or keep?
- Can print be useful rather than just promotional? (Reference guides, planning tools, motivation)

**About Dimensional Possibilities:**

- How can you move beyond flat posters and postcards?
- What dimensional formats create memorable unboxing or display experiences?
- Could print deliverables demonstrate the product’s organizational philosophy physically?

**About Timing:**

- Back-to-school season is critical. What print formats appear in August at college bookstores or Target?
- Are there other key moments? (Finals week care packages? Graduation gifts for incoming freshmen?)

**Avoid:**

- Generic 11x17 posters that look like every other student organization poster
- Postcards that immediately get recycled
- Brochures that just list features without strategic purpose
- Anything that duplicates what digital could do better

**Push For:**

- Formats that require hands-on interaction
- Print that serves dual purpose (promotional + functional)
- Dimensional solutions that create physical presence
- Pieces designed for specific strategic moments or locations

-----

### Digital Deliverables Strategic Questions

You must choose **two (2) digital deliverables** from the options provided. One option is designing the app interface or display board interface mockups—this allows you to define the visual language of the product itself.

**Before You Choose, Research:**

- Where do college students spend time online? (Not just “social media”—be specific)
- What digital formats do students actually engage with vs. scroll past?
- How do students discover new products? (Influencer reviews? Reddit threads? TikTok?)
- What builds trust in a digital context for this audience?

**Strategic Questions to Guide Your Choices:**

**About Interface Design (if you choose app/display mockups):**

- How does the visual interface communicate “reduces anxiety” rather than “another productivity app”?
- What design patterns do students already understand from apps they use daily?
- How do you show complexity of features without creating overwhelmed feeling?
- Does the interface design reinforce brand personality established in identity system?
- Should display board interface look different from mobile app interface? Why or why not?
- How do you visually communicate task breakdown and progress states?
- What does time-blocking look like in the interface?

**About Social Media Presence:**

- Which platform is most strategic for reaching college students right now? (Don’t assume—research)
- What content performs well in that space? (Product demos? User testimonials? Humor? Before/after transformations?)
- How do you create shareable content that students want to show roommates?
- Should tone differ across platforms, or stay consistent?

**About Digital Advertising:**

- If running paid ads, where would they appear? (Instagram? YouTube pre-roll? Spotify? Reddit?)
- What’s the attention span for ads in that environment?
- What single message hooks attention in 3 seconds?
- How do you communicate value prop when viewer can skip immediately?

**About Email/Retention:**

- Is email marketing relevant for students, or is email “where assignments go”?
- If creating email campaigns, what’s the context? (Cart abandonment? Back-to-school promotion? Tips for users?)
- How do you write email that doesn’t feel like spam from another productivity app?

**About Website/Landing Pages:**

- What’s the user journey? (Awareness → Consideration → Purchase)
- Do you need different landing pages for students vs. gift-giving parents?
- How much explanation is needed before someone understands the value?
- What objections must the website overcome? (Price? “Why not just use Canvas?” Skepticism about productivity tools?)

**About Video Content:**

- If creating video, what’s the distribution platform and length?
- Product demo? Testimonial? Problem/solution narrative? Founder story?
- How do you show physical + digital working together without boring technical explanation?
- How do you demonstrate task breakdown and time-blocking visually?

**Avoid:**

- Generic social media templates that could work for any product
- Websites that just list features without addressing emotional drivers
- Digital ads that explain too much (wrong medium for complex messaging)
- Interface mockups that prioritize aesthetics over usability

**Push For:**

- Interface design that demonstrates your strategic thinking about user needs
- Digital formats that create engagement, not just impressions
- Content designed for how students actually discover and evaluate products
- Experiences that build trust through authenticity, not corporate polish

-----

### Multi-Page Layout Strategic Questions

You must create **one (1) multi-page layout** with minimum 8 pages or slides. Think beyond obvious choices—what format serves StudyStream’s strategic goals?

**Before You Choose, Research:**

- What multi-page formats do students actually read vs. ignore?
- When do students engage with longer content? (During research phase? After purchase?)
- What format builds credibility with parents considering gifting this product?
- How do competing productivity products explain themselves in long-form?

**Strategic Questions to Guide Your Choice:**

**About Format Selection:**

- Sales presentation deck? Product guide? Brand book? Editorial feature? Educational booklet? Instruction manual?
- Who is the audience for this document—students? Parents? Campus bookstore buyers? Press/media?
- Where would this be encountered? (Website download? Inside product packaging? Sales meeting? Press kit?)
- Does it need to work in print, digital, or both?

**About Content Strategy:**

- Are you selling the product, explaining how to use it, or building brand credibility?
- How much of this should be educational vs. promotional?
- Should you show the product in context, or focus on lifestyle/benefits?
- Do you need to overcome objections or simply reinforce decision for someone already interested?

**About Emotional Journey:**

- What does the reader feel on page 1 vs. page 8?
- Are you building excitement, reducing anxiety, creating urgency, establishing trust?
- How do you maintain engagement across 8+ pages without losing attention?

**About Visual Strategy:**

- Heavy on photography? Illustration? Data visualization? User testimonials? Product shots?
- How do you show physical + digital product working together across multiple spreads?
- Should each spread standalone, or does narrative build sequentially?
- How do you visually demonstrate task breakdown and time-blocking concepts?

**About Differentiation:**

- What would a competitor create for this? How do you do something unexpected?
- Can the format itself reinforce brand personality? (Playful? Serious? Empowering?)
- Does the layout system demonstrate the organizational philosophy of the product?

**Specific Format Considerations:**

**If Product Guide:**

- For current users or prospective buyers?
- Feature explanation or use-case scenarios?
- How do you make 8 pages of features not feel like a technical manual?
- Do you walk through task breakdown and time-blocking as teaching moments?

**If Sales Deck:**

- Presenting to whom? (Campus bookstore buyers? Investors? Press?)
- What objections must you overcome? (Why not just use Canvas?)
- Balance between data/proof and emotional appeal?

**If Editorial Feature:**

- What publication? (Student newspaper? Productivity blog? Design magazine?)
- How do you make “sponsored content” not feel like ad?
- What’s the story beyond “here’s a product”?
- Could you feature real student stories demonstrating the problem?

**If Instructional Booklet:**

- Included in packaging or separate sales tool?
- How do you make setup/instructions reflect brand personality?
- Can instructions double as brand-building content?
- Opportunity to teach task breakdown methodology as part of setup?

**If Comparison Guide:**

- StudyStream vs. other solutions students currently use?
- Honest about limitations while emphasizing unique value?
- Helps students/parents make informed decision?

**Avoid:**

- Corporate presentation decks that feel like investor pitches
- Instruction manuals that are purely functional without brand personality
- Formats that students would never voluntarily read
- Content that just lists features without demonstrating use cases

**Push For:**

- Layouts that demonstrate your understanding of information hierarchy
- Formats that serve strategic purpose beyond “assignment requirement”
- Visual systems that could scale to other brand materials
- Content that balances utility with brand building
- Stories that show task breakdown and time-blocking in action

### Research Guidance: No Handed Answers

You need to conduct research to make informed strategic decisions. **Do not expect your instructor or this brief to tell you which competitors to analyze, which social platforms to prioritize, or which print formats to choose.**

**Your Research Responsibilities:**

**Competitive Landscape:**

- Who else is trying to solve academic organization for students?
- What do productivity apps claim? How do they position themselves?
- What do students complain about in app store reviews for these competitors?
- How do physical planners market themselves? What emotional language do they use?
- What does the LMS (Canvas, Blackboard) NOT do that creates opportunity?
- How do competing products explain task breakdown or time management features?

**Target Audience Deep Dive:**

- Interview actual college students (your classmates qualify)
- What apps/tools do they currently use? Why? What frustrates them?
- Where do they discover new products? What builds trust?
- What would make them pay for organization tools when free options exist?
- How much would they spend? What’s expensive vs. reasonable?
- Do they struggle with breaking large projects into steps? How do they currently handle this?
- How do they schedule study time vs. just tracking deadlines?

**Retail Environment:**

- Visit campus bookstore—what organizational products are sold? How are they displayed?
- Visit Target/Best Buy during back-to-school season—what competes for same dollars?
- What price points exist for productivity/organization products?
- What packaging formats are standard? Which stand out?

**Digital Ecosystem:**

- What hashtags do students use related to studying, organization, college life?
- Which influencers review productivity tools? What’s their review format?
- What subreddits discuss college organization? What questions get asked?
- Where do students ask for product recommendations?
- How do students talk about group project frustrations online?
- What study/productivity content goes viral on TikTok?

**You Must Discover:**

- Which social platform is most strategic (don’t assume Instagram because you use it)
- What print formats appear in student spaces (don’t guess—observe)
- Which emotional drivers matter most (don’t project—interview)
- What price feels right (don’t assume—research competitor pricing)
- How students currently handle task breakdown (ask them)
- What students want from group project coordination tools (interview)

**Research Methods:**

- User interviews (talk to students)
- Competitive analysis (study competitor marketing)
- Environmental observation (visit retail spaces, observe student spaces)
- Digital listening (read reviews, follow hashtags, lurk in Reddit threads)
- Surveys (if you want quantitative data)

### Collaboration with Programming Students

Your programming team partners are building the software platform that makes StudyStream function. You need to work together strategically.

**What Design Students Need from Programming Students:**

- Understanding of technical capabilities (what CAN the product do?)
- Screen dimensions and interface constraints for display board
- App functionality specifics (features for digital deliverables)
- How physical pins communicate with display (informs product photography/demos)
- Any technical limitations that affect marketing claims
- How task breakdown feature functions (UI/UX considerations)
- How time-blocking integrates with calendar views
- How study group scheduling tool works

**What Programming Students Need from Design Students:**

- User interface design direction (visual language, interaction patterns)
- Branding assets (logo, colors, typography for app interface)
- Understanding of target audience pain points (informs feature prioritization)
- Marketing messaging that accurately represents technical capabilities
- Visual design for task breakdown and progress state displays
- Interface concepts for time-blocking calendar integration

**Collaboration Checkpoints:**

**Week 2-3: Strategic Alignment**

- Programming team shares technical feasibility and MVP scope
- Design team shares target audience research
- Together: confirm that product features align with audience needs
- Discuss how task breakdown and time-blocking will function

**Week 4-5: Interface Design Collaboration**

- Design team creates interface mockups (if chosen as digital deliverable)
- Programming team provides feedback on technical feasibility
- Iterate together on user experience
- Align on visual treatment of progress states and time-block displays

**Week 8-9: Marketing Claims Review**

- Design team shares marketing materials
- Programming team confirms technical accuracy
- Ensure no overpromising of features
- Verify that task breakdown and time-blocking are explained accurately

**Communication Best Practices:**

- Shared project documentation (Google Drive, Notion, etc.)
- Regular check-ins (weekly minimum)
- Clear point-people from each team
- Respect each discipline’s expertise—designers don’t dictate code, programmers don’t dictate brand
- Ask questions when you don’t understand technical constraints or design decisions

### Final Notes

**This Project Tests Your Ability To:**

1. **Create differentiated positioning** when competitors exist (free LMS calendars, hundreds of task apps)
1. **Design for specific emotional needs** (reduce anxiety, create clarity) not just functional features
1. **Think strategically about touchpoints** (where should StudyStream appear to reach students?)
1. **Balance multiple audiences** (students who use it, parents who buy it)
1. **Communicate complex product** (physical + digital hybrid with advanced features) clearly and compellingly
1. **Make research-driven decisions** instead of assumptions about what students want
1. **Collaborate across disciplines** (work with programming students effectively)
1. **Address legitimate competition** (explain why StudyStream vs. Canvas + Google Calendar)

**You Will Be Evaluated On:**

- Strategic thinking (why these deliverables for this audience?)
- Brand differentiation (how is StudyStream positioned vs. competitors?)
- Visual identity strength (does brand personality come through?)
- Execution quality (professional-level design work)
- Research depth (evidence of user understanding)
- System thinking (do all pieces work together as cohesive campaign?)
- Problem-solving (how do you sell against free institutional tools?)

**Success Looks Like:**

A brand identity and campaign that makes college students think: *“Finally, something that actually gets what it’s like to be a student right now. This might actually help. And it does things Canvas can’t.”*

And makes parents think: *“This would genuinely support my student without me having to nag them. It’s worth the investment because it addresses real problems I’ve seen them struggle with.”*
