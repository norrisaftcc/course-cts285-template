# RenovateRight Creative Brief

**White-Label Application: Home Renovation & Project Management System**  
**Core Platform: Task Management System (Platform #2 of 6)**

-----

## PART 1: CREATIVE BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Project Overview

You are creating a complete brand identity and marketing campaign for **RenovateRight**, a physical + digital project management system designed for anyone managing complex home improvement projects—homeowners coordinating voluntary renovations, homeowners managing insurance claim repairs, DIY craft makers tracking production and inventory, and partners working together on fixer-upper investments.

Your programming team partners are building the software platform. Your job is to create the brand that makes this product essential for one of three distinct markets (your strategic choice) who are all drowning in budget tracking, contractor coordination, material lists, timeline uncertainty, and the constant question: “Are we on track or spiraling out of control?”

### Target Audience Overview

RenovateRight serves **three distinct markets** with overlapping product needs but different emotional drivers and purchase contexts. You will research all three and **strategically choose which market to position your campaign toward**.

### Company Background

**RenovateRight** was founded in 2020 by **Jordan Reyes and Sam Chen**, friends who partnered to buy a 1960s fixer-upper as both investment property and passion project. Their plan: live in it while slowly renovating, maximize value through sweat equity and strategic financing, eventually sell or rent it out.

They started with a home renovation loan to address critical repairs—roof replacement, foundation work, HVAC upgrade. As first-time renovators managing contractors, budgets, and materials, they quickly realized how chaotic the process was. Jordan and Sam used spreadsheets, physical binders, email threads with contractors, and constant text conversations with each other trying to stay aligned on decisions and spending.

Six months into their renovation, a pipe burst during winter freeze caused significant water damage. The insurance claim process added a whole new layer of complexity: adjuster visits, documentation requirements, tracking what was covered versus out-of-pocket, managing draw payments, and proving work completion for reimbursement. But it also created opportunity—they could upgrade finishes within the insurance coverage and customize repairs to their vision.

That’s when they realized: renovation apps were designed for dream kitchen projects, not insurance claims. Insurance claim tools helped with paperwork but didn’t manage the actual construction project. Nothing handled BOTH. And nothing helped partners stay aligned on the hundreds of decisions that come with renovation.

After completing their renovation (successful flip/rental), Jordan and Sam built RenovateRight—initially for their next fixer-upper project. Beta testers included fellow house flippers, homeowners managing insurance claims, and unexpectedly, a friend running an Etsy woodworking shop who said “this is exactly what I need for managing materials and production.”

The company’s mission: **Enable successful project completion—whether renovation, recovery, or production—by making budgets, timelines, and collaboration visible and manageable.**

Jordan and Sam’s philosophy: “Whether you chose this project or it was forced on you, whether you’re building your dream home or building products to sell, you need the same things: budget control, timeline visibility, and a way to work with partners without losing your mind. RenovateRight handles the chaos so you can focus on the outcome.”

### Brand Personality

RenovateRight is the capable, organized partner who keeps projects on track when things get chaotic.

**Brand Voice:**

- Practical and resourceful (not aspirational HGTV fantasy)
- Calm and competent (reduces stress, doesn’t add to it)
- Partnership-oriented (designed for collaboration)
- Honest about renovation/project reality (acknowledges it’s hard)
- Empowering without being preachy
- Supportive without being condescending

**Visual Identity Direction (your job to develop):**

- Should feel practical and professional
- Organized and systematic (conveys control)
- Modern but approachable (not cold tech)
- Works across contexts (home renovation, insurance claims, craft production)
- Appeals to both genders equally (partnership tool)
- Conveys reliability and thoroughness

**Brand Personality Spectrum (you choose where to position):**

- Utilitarian ←→ Aspirational
- Stress-reduction ←→ Empowerment
- Practical ←→ Creative
- Process-focused ←→ Outcome-focused

**Not This:**

- HGTV/home improvement show aesthetic (unrealistic optimism)
- Insurance company branding (cold, bureaucratic)
- Craft/artisan aesthetic (too niche, excludes renovation users)
- Corporate project management (too stiff)
- App startup minimalism (doesn’t communicate comprehensive tool)

### Campaign Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Position RenovateRight as the essential project management system for your chosen market (voluntary renovation, insurance claims, OR craft production) who need to prevent budget disasters and keep complex projects on track.

**What Your Design Should Accomplish:**

1. **Choose Your Market Strategically**
- Research all three markets deeply
- Select the market with strongest opportunity or that you can reach most effectively
- Your choice determines everything: messaging, visual identity, where you advertise
- Justify your market selection with research
1. **Build Trust for Your Chosen Market**
- Voluntary renovation: Trust that this prevents budget disasters and partner conflicts
- Insurance claims: Trust that this handles both paperwork AND project management
- Craft production: Trust that this tracks business operations without killing creativity
1. **Differentiate from Generic Tools**
- Not a spreadsheet (too fragile, no mobile access)
- Not a home design app (inspiration ≠ project management)
- Not insurance claim software (paperwork ≠ construction coordination)
- Not craft business software (too complex, not project-focused)
- Physical + digital = always visible command center
1. **Address Partnership/Collaboration**
- Partners (spouses/friends) need aligned decision-making
- Contractors need selective access to relevant information
- Insurance adjusters need documentation
- Customers need order status
- Different collaboration needs per market
1. **Position as Investment Worth Making**
- ROI varies by market:
  - Voluntary renovation: Prevents $5K-$20K budget overruns
  - Insurance claims: Ensures full coverage payout, prevents adjuster disputes
  - Craft production: Increases profitability through better cost tracking
- One prevented disaster pays for the system

### Why This Matters (Market-Specific)

#### For Voluntary Home Renovation

**The Current Problem:**

Homeowners planning voluntary renovations face chaos: Pinterest boards full of inspiration but no way to track actual budget and timeline, spreadsheets that become overwhelming with hundreds of line items, email threads with contractors where critical information gets buried, physical folders of contracts and receipts that live at home (not accessible on-site), constant partner discussions about budget and decisions that lead to arguments because there’s no shared source of truth.

What breaks: budget overruns happen gradually ($200 here, $500 there adds up to $10K over), contractor delays cascade (tile guy late → plumber delayed → project extends 3 weeks), partners disagree about spending because they remember conversations differently, materials purchased twice or not at all because no shared list, decisions made without both partners’ input lead to resentment.

**How RenovateRight Addresses This:**

**Shared Budget Visibility:** Both partners see every expense in real-time. Display board in kitchen shows running budget vs. actual spend. “We agreed on $30K bathroom, we’re at $28.5K with tile still to buy” is visible to both partners—prevents surprise overruns and arguments.

**Partner Alignment:** Major purchase approval workflow: when one partner enters $3K lighting fixture, system prompts “This is a major purchase—send approval request to partner?” Other partner sees request on their phone, reviews, approves or discusses. Prevents “you spent WHAT without asking me?” fights.

**Contractor Coordination:** Share project timeline with contractors via portal. Tile installer sees: rough plumbing complete (green), drywall in progress (yellow), ready for tile install (date). Contractor knows when site will be ready, homeowner knows when to expect them. Reduces “when are you coming?” texts.

**Materials Management:** Shared shopping list with both partners. Husband at Home Depot sees shopping list on phone: “subway tile (47 sq ft), grout (3 bags), spacers.” Wife at lighting store sees same list, can add items. No duplicate purchases, no forgotten materials, no “I thought you were getting that.”

**Timeline Reality:** Visual timeline shows dependencies: can’t install cabinets until electrical is done, can’t tile until plumbing inspected. Homeowners see realistic completion date based on actual task sequence, not optimistic contractor promises. Prevents “why isn’t this done yet?” frustration.

**Different from Home Design Apps:** Houzz and Pinterest show beautiful finished projects but don’t manage the chaos of getting there. RenovateRight isn’t about inspiration—it’s about execution. It’s the system that gets you from “we want this kitchen” to “we completed this kitchen on budget and still like each other.”

#### For Insurance Claim Renovation

**The Current Problem:**

Homeowners managing insurance claim renovations face double chaos: all the complexity of voluntary renovation PLUS insurance bureaucracy, adjuster documentation requirements, proving work completion for draw payments, tracking what’s covered versus out-of-pocket, managing multiple contractor bids required by insurance, and often dealing with trauma of home damage while displaced to temporary housing.

Current reality: folders full of insurance paperwork, adjuster notes scribbled on napkins, email threads with claim numbers and approval codes, physical receipts for reimbursement claims, photos scattered across phone and camera, contractor bids in different formats, confusion about what insurance will actually pay vs. what they estimated, stress of temporary housing costs while renovation drags on.

What breaks: insurance denies reimbursement because no receipt, draw payment delayed because can’t prove work completed, adjuster approved verbally but homeowner has no record when claim is denied, upgrade costs mixed with covered repairs causing budget confusion, contractor work doesn’t match insurance-approved scope, homeowner undersettles claim because didn’t document everything.

**How RenovateRight Addresses This:**

**Claims Documentation:** Separate budget tracking for “covered by insurance” vs. “out of pocket upgrades.” Kitchen flood damaged cabinets and flooring—insurance covers $12K for builder-grade replacements. Homeowners want to upgrade to custom cabinets ($18K) and hardwood ($8K). RenovateRight shows: $12K insurance coverage, $14K out-of-pocket for upgrades. Clear separation prevents budget confusion.

**Draw Payment Tracking:** Insurance pays in installments (draws) after work phases complete. RenovateRight tracks: Draw 1 ($15K - demolition complete) PAID, Draw 2 ($20K - rough-in complete) PENDING, Draw 3 ($18K - finish work) NOT YET REQUESTED. Homeowner knows what insurance owes, when to request next payment, prevents cash flow crisis.

**Photo Documentation with Timestamps:** Automatically timestamps all project photos. Adjuster visits and approves scope. Contractor completes work. Insurance later disputes coverage. Homeowner has timestamped photos: damage (March 5), adjuster visit (March 8), approved scope document (March 10), completed work (April 22). Prevents insurance from claiming “this wasn’t originally approved.”

**Adjuster Communication Log:** Searchable record of all conversations. “Adjuster said on March 15 that upgraded fixtures would be covered within total settlement.” When insurance denies upgrade cost, homeowner has documentation. Prevents “he said / they said” disputes.

**Receipt Management:** Scan receipts immediately, tag to budget categories, mark as “for reimbursement.” Insurance requires proof homeowner paid contractor before releasing draw. RenovateRight generates reimbursement packet: receipts, photos of completed work, contractor invoices—everything insurance needs in one submission.

**Multiple Contractor Bids:** Insurance requires 2-3 estimates. RenovateRight tracks all bids side-by-side: Contractor A ($22K, 6 weeks), Contractor B ($19K, 8 weeks), Contractor C ($24K, 4 weeks). Compare costs, timelines, scope. Submit to insurance with documentation.

**Different from Insurance Claim Software:** Claim management software helps with insurance paperwork but doesn’t manage actual construction project. RenovateRight handles BOTH: organize insurance documentation AND coordinate contractors, materials, budget, timeline. One system from “house damaged” to “house restored.”

#### For DIY Craft Production

**The Current Problem:**

Craft makers running small businesses face production chaos: materials scattered in workshop (what do I have? what do I need?), spreadsheets tracking inventory that are always outdated, forgetting material costs when pricing products (am I even making profit?), custom orders with promised delivery dates that conflict, craft fair schedules on paper calendars that aren’t visible when booking new shows, not knowing if product line is profitable until tax time.

Current reality: bins of beads/wood/fabric with unknown quantities, supplier websites bookmarked but no system for reordering, notebooks with customer orders and deadlines, mental math for “does $45 selling price cover materials + time?”, calendar showing craft fairs but not prep deadlines, surprise when popular item sells out with no materials to make more.

What breaks: accepted custom order without checking material availability (now scrambling to source), priced product at $30 when materials alone cost $25 (losing money), double-booked two craft fairs same weekend, forgot to prep inventory for Saturday market, can’t remember which products actually make profit vs. which are labor of love, ran out of popular item because didn’t track inventory.

**How RenovateRight Addresses This:**

**Materials Inventory Tracking:** Visual display board shows materials on hand. “Silver wire: 15 ft (LOW - reorder at 20 ft), Jump rings: 200 (OK), Gemstone beads: 45 (OK).” Maker sees inventory at a glance, gets alerts before running out. Prevents “can’t fill order because out of materials” emergencies.

**Product Profitability Tracking:** Each product shows cost breakdown. “Gemstone bracelet: Materials $12, Time 1.5 hours ($22.50 at $15/hour), Total cost $34.50, Selling price $55, Profit $20.50.” Maker sees which products are profitable vs. which need price increase or discontinuation.

**Production Timeline:** Custom orders with deadlines tracked visually. Customer A: wooden cutting boards (due May 15), Customer B: ceramic bowls (due May 22), Customer C: jewelry set (due June 1). Timeline shows when to start each project to meet deadlines. Prevents last-minute panic.

**Craft Fair Management:** Event schedule with prep deadlines. “June 5 Saturday Market: Inventory prep due June 3, Setup 7am.” Maker sees upcoming shows, deadlines for creating inventory, prevents double-booking.

**Material Cost Per Product:** When pricing new product, maker enters materials used: “Walnut wood (12 board ft @ $8/ft = $96), Finish ($8), Hardware ($15).” System calculates: $119 materials cost. Maker can price intelligently at $200 to cover materials + labor + profit.

**Reorder Management:** When materials run low, system shows: “Silver wire below reorder point—last purchased from SupplierX at $45/roll.” Maker knows what to order, from whom, at what price. Prevents scrambling when materials run out.

**Different from Craft Business Software:** Etsy shop management tools track sales but not production/materials. Accounting software tracks money but not inventory/materials. RenovateRight manages the MAKING side of craft business: what you have, what you need, what it costs, when you can deliver.

## PART 3: USER RESEARCH

### Market Option 1: Voluntary Home Renovation

#### User Story 1A: The Couple Remodeling Their Kitchen

**Background:**
Amanda and Marcus are a married couple (ages 38 and 41) who’ve lived in their suburban home for 8 years. They’re planning a $40,000 kitchen remodel—their first major renovation. Both work full-time (Amanda: accountant, Marcus: high school teacher). They have two kids (ages 6 and 9). They’re hiring contractors for structural/electrical/plumbing work but plan to do some finish work themselves (painting, hardware installation).

**Current System:**
Amanda has a massive Excel spreadsheet with budget tracking. Marcus has a Pinterest board with design inspiration. They use a physical binder for contracts and receipts. Communication with contractors happens via text message and email. They discuss decisions and budget during evening kitchen table conversations that often turn into arguments.

**Pain Points:**

- Budget confusion: Amanda tracks spending in spreadsheet but Marcus doesn’t check it before making purchases—they discovered they were $3,500 over budget only after tile was ordered
- Communication breakdown: Marcus told cabinet contractor “light gray” based on Pinterest photo, Amanda wanted “warm white” based on paint sample she picked—costly cabinet restain required
- Timeline anxiety: Contractor said “6-8 weeks” but it’s been 10 weeks and kitchen still not functional—family eating takeout every night, expenses mounting
- Partner resentment: Amanda feels like she’s managing everything while Marcus “just picks pretty pictures.” Marcus feels like Amanda vetoes every choice he makes
- Decision paralysis: 47 decisions to make (fixtures, finishes, hardware, backsplash, paint, countertop edge profile) and no system for tracking what they’ve decided
- Lost receipts: Need to return wrong-sized sink, can’t find receipt in physical binder chaos

**Quote:**
*“We’re eight weeks into a kitchen remodel and we barely speak to each other anymore. Every conversation turns into ‘why did you spend that without asking me?’ or ‘I thought you were handling that.’ We have a spreadsheet, a Pinterest board, a binder full of papers, and text threads with three different contractors. I can’t find anything, I don’t know what we’ve actually decided, and I have no idea if we’re on track or drowning. I just want to see everything in one place and know that we’re making decisions together.”* - Amanda

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Shared budget visibility: Both partners see spending in real-time on display board in home office and on phone apps
- Decision tracking: “Cabinet color: agreed warm white (Benjamin Moore OC-17), approved by both partners May 12”—documented consensus
- Purchase approval workflow: Marcus sees $800 light fixture he loves, adds to wishlist, sends approval request to Amanda before buying—prevents unilateral spending
- Contractor timeline sharing: Cabinet maker sees timeline portal showing: rough electrical complete, ready for cabinet install June 5. Marcus and Amanda see same timeline—everyone aligned
- Materials shopping list: Shared list accessible to both—Marcus at Home Depot buys grout, Amanda at lighting store buys pendant, no duplicate purchases
- Receipt storage: Scan receipts via phone, tagged to budget categories, searchable when need to return items

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **partnership alignment and budget control**. Amanda and Marcus are good people in renovation chaos. Messaging around “keep partners aligned,” “shared decisions,” and “budget transparency” will resonate. Visual metaphors of partnership, clarity, and peace.

#### User Story 1B: The DIY Bathroom Renovator

**Background:**
Chris is a 45-year-old single homeowner planning to DIY-renovate his hall bathroom ($8,000 budget). He’s handy and has watched hundreds of YouTube tutorials. He’s doing all work himself except tile (hired contractor). He works full-time in IT and renovates on evenings and weekends. Timeline: hoping to complete in 8 weeks.

**Current System:**
Chris uses a Google Sheet for budget tracking, keeps receipts in a shoebox, has a notebook with measurements and task lists, saves YouTube tutorial links in browser bookmarks. He shops at Home Depot and Lowe’s, often forgetting which materials he already bought.

**Pain Points:**

- Bought wrong-size vanity because didn’t double-check measurements before store trip—had to return and exchange (2-hour round trip wasted)
- Forgot he already bought plumbing supplies, bought duplicates ($75 wasted)
- Can’t remember which YouTube video had the good tip about tile spacing—scrolled through 40 bookmarks trying to find it
- Started demo before confirming tile contractor availability—bathroom is now unusable for 3 weeks instead of planned 1 week
- Budget tracking in spreadsheet on laptop, not accessible while at Home Depot—bought $200 of materials not realizing he was at budget limit
- Timeline is in his head—no visibility into “if tile takes 3 days, when can I start paint?”
- Keeps forgetting small items (caulk, touch-up paint, grout sealer) and making multiple store trips

**Quote:**
*“I’ve watched every bathroom renovation video on YouTube and I know I can do this work. But I’m so disorganized. I buy stuff twice, forget what I need, start tasks before I’m ready. I have measurements on sticky notes, budget in a spreadsheet I can’t access at the store, and task lists in three different notebooks. I need to see: what I need to buy, what I’ve already bought, what I can work on this weekend, and whether I’m on budget. Just one place for everything.”* - Chris

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Materials shopping list with purchase tracking: “Vanity 30” x 21” - PURCHASED May 5 Home Depot, Faucet brushed nickel - NEED TO BUY”
- Mobile access to budget: At Home Depot, Chris checks phone: “$7,200 spent of $8,000 budget, $800 remaining”—decides against expensive light fixture
- Task dependencies: Can’t start tile until vanity removed, can’t paint until tile complete. Visual timeline shows realistic sequence
- Measurement documentation: “Vanity opening: 30.25” wide x 21” deep (measured May 1)”—reference at store on phone
- Link storage: Save YouTube tutorials tagged to tasks: “Tile installation: [video link], Faucet install: [video link]”
- Photo documentation: Before photos (May 1), demo complete (May 8), progress photos—track transformation

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **DIY empowerment and organization**. Chris is capable but overwhelmed. Messaging around “stay organized,” “one place for everything,” and “DIY confidence” will resonate. Visual identity should feel accessible to DIYers, not just professionals.

### Market Option 2: Insurance Claim Renovation

#### User Story 2A: The Family Managing Fire Damage Recovery

**Background:**
The Martinez family (parents ages 36 and 39, three kids ages 4, 7, 11) experienced kitchen fire that caused $85,000 in damage (kitchen destroyed, smoke damage throughout house). Insurance approved $78,000 for repairs (they’re fighting for additional coverage). They’re living in temporary housing (insurance covers 6 months) while house is repaired. Timeline: 4-5 months estimated.

**Current System:**
Maria (mom) has physical folders for insurance documents, contractor bids, receipts. She communicates with adjuster via email and phone (writes notes on paper). Their contractor sends text updates. They have photos of damage on phones. They’re tracking draw payments and reimbursements in a notebook.

**Pain Points:**

- Adjuster initially approved $12K for kitchen cabinets (builder grade). Contractor bid came in at $11K for same, but Martinez family wants to upgrade to $16K semi-custom—unclear how much insurance will cover vs. out-of-pocket
- Draw payment confusion: Insurance pays in 4 installments. Contractor asking for payment but Maria doesn’t know if insurance has released Draw 2 yet—worried about cash flow
- Lost adjuster approval: Adjuster verbally approved upgraded flooring during March 15 visit. Insurance now denying upgrade cost. Maria has no record of conversation except her memory
- Receipt chaos: Insurance requires receipts for reimbursement. Maria has shoebox of receipts, some faded, some lost. Can’t remember which are for reimbursement vs. out-of-pocket
- Contractor bid comparison: Insurance required 3 contractor estimates. Maria has PDFs from three contractors in different formats—can’t easily compare costs, timelines, scope
- Photo documentation gaps: Took photos of fire damage on day of fire. Adjuster wants before/during/after photos with dates. Maria’s photos have timestamps but are scattered across phone and husband’s phone
- Temporary housing stress: Insurance covers hotel for 6 months. It’s been 3 months and contractor says “2-3 more months”—will insurance extend coverage if project runs long?

**Quote:**
*“Our house burned and we’re living in a hotel with three kids. I’m managing insurance paperwork, contractor coordination, and trying to restore our home while dealing with trauma. I have folders of documents, emails with claim numbers, texts from contractors, photos everywhere. The adjuster approved things verbally that insurance is now denying. I can’t prove what was said. I don’t know if we can afford the upgrades we want. I don’t know when we can go home. I just need one place where I can see: what insurance approved, what we’ve spent, what we’re owed, and when this nightmare will be over.”* - Maria Martinez

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Covered vs. out-of-pocket budget separation: “$78K insurance approved, $15K out-of-pocket upgrades, total project $93K”—clear separation prevents confusion
- Draw payment tracking: “Draw 1 ($20K demolition/disposal) PAID 4/15, Draw 2 ($30K framing/rough-in) SUBMITTED 5/3 PENDING, Draw 3 ($18K finish work) NOT READY”—Maria knows exact status
- Adjuster communication log: “March 15: Adjuster John Smith (claim #45-882-K) verbally approved upgrade to engineered hardwood within total settlement”—searchable, timestamped record
- Photo documentation with auto-timestamps: All project photos automatically timestamped and organized by phase: Fire damage (2/28), Demolition (3/20), Framing (4/10)—comprehensive record
- Receipt scanning and reimbursement tracking: Scan receipts immediately, tag “for reimbursement.” Generate reimbursement packet with all receipts and photos—submit to insurance
- Contractor bid comparison: Three bids side-by-side with costs, timelines, scope compared. Submit to insurance with RenovateRight-generated comparison report
- Timeline with temporary housing: Visual timeline shows estimated completion (July 15)—Maria can see if project will exceed insurance’s 6-month hotel coverage, request extension proactively

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **disaster recovery support and documentation**. The Martinez family is traumatized and stressed. Messaging around “document everything,” “get your full coverage,” and “restore your home with confidence” will resonate. Tone must be empathetic, not transactional.

#### User Story 2B: The Homeowner Managing Pipe Burst Repairs

**Background:**
David is a 52-year-old single homeowner whose pipes burst during winter freeze, causing $45,000 in water damage (finished basement destroyed, first-floor flooring damaged). Insurance approved $38,000 for repairs. He’s still living in house (basement unusable, main floor functional). He works from home and is managing renovation while working full-time.

**Current System:**
David uses Excel spreadsheet for budget tracking, keeps insurance documents in physical folder, emails with adjuster and contractors. He’s taking photos on his phone. He’s trying to track draw payments and reimbursements manually.

**Pain Points:**

- Scope creep confusion: During demolition, contractor found mold behind drywall (not originally part of claim). Insurance says mold coverage is separate claim. David doesn’t know if mold remediation is covered or out-of-pocket
- Missed reimbursement opportunities: Insurance covers “reasonable expenses” during repairs (hotel if needed, storage unit for basement furniture). David paid for storage unit ($600) but didn’t submit for reimbursement until reminded by friend—almost missed deadline
- Photo documentation for upgrades: Basement had builder-grade carpet ($2K replacement cost). David wants to upgrade to luxury vinyl plank ($4K). Insurance says they’ll only cover $2K. David can’t prove what original carpet quality was—no photos from before damage
- Contractor change order chaos: Original bid was $36K. Contractor submitted change order for $4K (additional framing discovered during demo). Is this covered by insurance or David’s responsibility? Unclear from original scope of work
- Timeline for work: Insurance adjuster said “repairs should take 6-8 weeks.” It’s been 12 weeks. Insurance asking why taking so long. David doesn’t have documentation showing contractor delays, material delays, inspection delays
- Payment disputes: Contractor wants payment for demolition phase. Insurance hasn’t released Draw 1 yet. Contractor threatening to stop work. David doesn’t have cash to pay out-of-pocket and get reimbursed later

**Quote:**
*“Managing an insurance claim while trying to work full-time is overwhelming. I have spreadsheets, folders, emails, photos scattered everywhere. The contractor finds new damage and I don’t know if insurance covers it. They approved $38K but I’ve already spent $41K—is insurance going to cover the difference or am I eating the cost? I need to see what was originally approved, what changed, what’s covered, what’s not. I need proof of everything or insurance won’t pay. I just want my basement back and to know I won’t be financially destroyed by this.”* - David

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Scope documentation: Original approved scope vs. change orders tracked separately. “Original scope: $38K approved by insurance. Change order 1: Mold remediation $3K - PENDING INSURANCE REVIEW”—clear record
- Covered expenses tracking: “Storage unit (3 months) $600 - eligible for reimbursement, submit by June 30”—alerts for reimbursement opportunities and deadlines
- Before/during/after photos: Auto-organized photo gallery with timestamps. “Basement carpet before damage (Dec 2023), water damage (Jan 15 2024), demolished (Feb 5 2024)”—proof for insurance
- Change order management: Contractor submits change order for additional work. David logs in RenovateRight: “Change order: additional framing $4K, reason: water damage behind walls, submitted to insurance Feb 28, APPROVED March 5 $3.5K”—documented trail
- Timeline documentation: Visual timeline shows all delays: “Demolition complete Feb 12 (3 days late due to contractor crew shortage), Framing inspection Feb 20 (2-day delay waiting for inspector)”—proof for insurance when they ask “why so long?”
- Draw payment status alerts: “Contractor requesting payment for demolition phase ($9K). Draw 1 status: SUBMITTED to insurance Feb 15, PENDING approval. Contact insurance for status update.”—prevents contractor conflict

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **claims advocacy and financial protection**. David is navigating insurance bureaucracy alone. Messaging around “document everything for insurance,” “protect your settlement,” and “prove what you’re owed” will resonate. Visual identity should feel trustworthy and thorough.

### Market Option 3: DIY Craft Production

#### User Story 3A: The Etsy Jewelry Maker Scaling Production

**Background:**
Keisha is a 32-year-old jewelry maker selling handmade gemstone jewelry on Etsy and at local craft fairs. She started as hobby 3 years ago, now makes $35K/year (part-time alongside day job as graphic designer). She works from home workshop. She’s trying to scale to full-time craft business but struggling with organization. She manages inventory for 15 product styles with custom variations.

**Current System:**
Keisha uses Google Sheets for inventory tracking (often outdated), keeps materials in labeled bins in workshop, has physical calendar for craft fair dates, uses Etsy for orders, calculator app for pricing products. She often forgets material costs when pricing new designs.

**Pain Points:**

- Accepted custom order for 20 bracelets (wedding favors) without checking materials on hand—discovered she only had enough gemstone beads for 12, had to overnight ship beads at high cost, wiping out profit
- Pricing mistakes: Created beautiful necklace with semi-precious stones, priced at $45 based on “what seems right.” Later calculated actual costs: $28 materials + 3 hours labor at $15/hour = $73 cost. Lost $28 on sale
- Craft fair disaster: Double-booked two fairs same weekend because paper calendar didn’t show conflict. Had to cancel one (lost $75 booth fee, damaged relationship with organizer)
- Inventory chaos: Best-selling item (turquoise bracelet) sold out. Customer wants one. Keisha searches workshop for 30 minutes—finds materials for 3 more, makes them. Later discovers she logged making 10 last month but can only account for 7. Where did 3 go?
- Material reordering: Ran out of silver wire mid-project. Couldn’t remember which supplier, what gauge, what price. Spent 2 hours searching old orders
- Production timeline: Accepted custom order “delivery in 2 weeks” without checking current workload. Already has 3 orders due that week. Now working 16-hour days to meet all deadlines
- Tax time nightmare: Accountant asks “what were your material costs?” Keisha spent weeks reconstructing receipts and inventory to calculate business expenses

**Quote:**
*“I love making jewelry but I’m terrible at the business side. I accept orders without checking if I have materials. I price things by gut feeling and lose money. I double-book craft fairs. My inventory tracking is a joke—I have no idea what I actually have in my workshop. I need to see: what materials I have, what I need to reorder, whether my products are actually profitable, and when I can deliver custom orders. If I can’t get organized, I’ll never be able to do this full-time.”* - Keisha

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Materials inventory with alerts: “Gemstone beads (turquoise): 45 units, LOW STOCK reorder at 60 units. Silver wire (20ga): 150 ft OK. Jump rings: 200 units OK”—visual display board shows inventory at a glance
- Product profitability tracking: “Turquoise bracelet: Materials $8 (beads $5, wire $1.50, findings $1.50), Time 45 min ($11.25 at $15/hour), Total cost $19.25, Etsy price $35, Profit $15.75”—Keisha sees which products make money
- Production capacity planning: Custom order request: 20 bracelets needed by June 15. Current orders: 3 necklaces due June 1, 5 bracelets due June 8. Timeline shows: “Available production time June 8-15 = 20 hours. Custom order requires 15 hours (45 min per bracelet). CAN ACCEPT ORDER.”—prevents over-commitment
- Craft fair calendar with prep deadlines: “June 12 Saturday Market: Booth setup 8am, Inventory prep deadline June 10”—visual timeline prevents double-booking, ensures inventory ready
- Material cost per product: When designing new product, Keisha logs materials: “Amethyst beads (12) @ $0.75 each = $9, Silver chain (18”) = $3.50, Clasp = $1”—total materials $13.50. Price at $38 to cover materials + labor + profit
- Supplier management: “Silver wire: Usually order from SupplierX 20ga 100ft $28, last ordered May 3”—when running low, know exactly what to reorder
- Tax documentation: Year-end report shows total materials purchased by category, products sold, inventory value—export for accountant

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **craft business organization without killing creativity**. Keisha is artist who needs business systems. Messaging around “stay organized,” “know your profitability,” and “grow your craft business” will resonate. Visual identity should appeal to makers, not feel corporate.

#### User Story 3B: The Woodworker Managing Custom Furniture Orders

**Background:**
Tom is a 47-year-old woodworker who builds custom furniture (tables, cutting boards, shelving) from his garage workshop. He sells at farmers markets and takes custom orders via Instagram and word-of-mouth. He makes $25K/year (side business alongside full-time job as electrician). He wants to quit electrician job and do woodworking full-time but needs to increase profitability and efficiency.

**Current System:**
Tom uses physical notebooks for customer orders and measurements, keeps receipts in envelope, has materials (lumber, finishes, hardware) in workshop with no inventory system. He prices based on “similar projects” without calculating actual costs.

**Pain Points:**

- Material waste: Bought 40 board feet of walnut ($320) for dining table project. Used 32 board feet. Has 8 board feet leftover but didn’t track it. Bought 12 more board feet for next project when he already had 8—wasted $64
- Underpricing: Customer ordered custom coffee table. Tom quoted $600 based on previous similar table. After completion calculated actual costs: $280 materials, 18 hours labor at $25/hour = $450, total $730. Lost $130 on project
- Double-booked delivery: Promised dining table delivery “early June” to Customer A, cutting board set “first week June” to Customer B. Didn’t realize both due same week. Worked 60 hours that week to complete both
- Forgot custom specifications: Customer ordered table “36” x 60” with walnut top and steel legs.” Tom built table, delivered it. Customer says “I asked for 42” x 72”.” Tom has no record—had to rebuild at his expense ($400 loss)
- Can’t find supplier pricing: Needs to order Danish oil finish. Can’t remember if RocklerWoodworking or WoodcraftSupply had better price. Spends hour researching prices that he’s researched before
- Production timeline guessing: Customer asks “can you build X by Y date?” Tom guesses based on “feels doable”—often wrong, leads to rushed work or delays
- No profitability visibility: Has vague sense some projects “go well” and others “aren’t worth it” but can’t identify which products are actually profitable

**Quote:**
*“I’m a craftsman, not a businessman. I love building furniture but I lose money on half my projects because I don’t track costs properly. I forget what materials I have and buy duplicates. I don’t know which products are profitable. I accept orders without checking if I have time to complete them. If I want to quit my electrician job and do this full-time, I need to get organized and profitable. I need to know: what materials I have, what projects are worth taking, and what I should actually charge.”* - Tom

**How RenovateRight Helps:**

- Lumber inventory tracking: “Walnut: 8 board feet remaining from Table Project A, Black walnut: 15 board feet, Maple: 22 board feet”—Tom sees what’s in workshop before buying more
- Product profitability analysis: “Coffee table (48” x 24”): Materials $180 (lumber $140, finish $25, hardware $15), Time 12 hours ($300 at $25/hour), Total cost $480, Selling price $600, Profit $120”—Tom sees if project worth taking
- Custom order specifications: Customer order documented: “Client: Sarah Johnson, Dining table 42” x 72” walnut top with steel hairpin legs, agreed price $850, delivery June 15”—timestamped record prevents disputes
- Production timeline with capacity: Current projects logged: Table A (16 hours remaining, due June 10), Shelving (4 hours, due June 5). New order request: Coffee table (12 hours, customer wants June 8). Timeline shows: “Over capacity—can deliver June 15”—realistic scheduling
- Supplier price tracking: “Danish oil finish: WoodcraftSupply $18/qt (best price), last ordered April 15”—when reordering, see best supplier and price
- Material cost per project: When quoting custom table, Tom enters dimensions and materials: “Walnut (30 board feet @ $8/ft = $240), steel legs ($60), finish ($30)”—total materials $330. Add labor (15 hours @ $25 = $375), overhead, profit = quote $950
- Project profitability trends: Year-end analysis shows: “Cutting boards: avg profit $25 per 2 hours = $12.50/hour. Dining tables: avg profit $200 per 16 hours = $12.50/hour. Coffee tables: avg profit $120 per 8 hours = $15/hour”—coffee tables most profitable, focus there

**Design Takeaway:**
Your brand must communicate **craft business professionalism and growth**. Tom is skilled craftsman who needs business systems to go full-time. Messaging around “know your costs,” “price profitably,” and “turn your craft into career” will resonate. Visual identity should feel workshop-appropriate, practical.

## Current Behaviors & Why Existing Solutions Fail

### For All Markets

**What Users Currently Use:**

1. **Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)**
- **Why it fails:** Not accessible on mobile at store/on-site. No collaboration (partners can’t both edit easily). Becomes overwhelming with hundreds of rows. No photos, no receipts attached. Manual updates. No alerts.
1. **Physical Binders/Folders**
- **Why it fails:** Lives at home, not accessible on-site or at store. Can’t search. Receipts fade. No collaboration. No timeline. No budget calculations.
1. **Email + Text Communication**
- **Why it fails:** Information buried in threads. Can’t find past conversations. No central record. Different conversations with different people. No budget or timeline tracking.
1. **Note Apps or Physical Notebooks**
- **Why it fails:** Scattered notes across multiple places. Not searchable. No budget tracking. No photos. Not collaborative. Easy to lose.
1. **Home Design Apps (Houzz, Pinterest)**
- **Why it fails:** Great for inspiration, useless for project management. No budget, timeline, materials, contractor coordination. Different tool for different purpose.
1. **Insurance Company Portal (for claims)**
- **Why it fails:** Handles claims paperwork but not actual project management. Doesn’t coordinate contractors, materials, budget. Read-only access to claim status.
1. **Craft Business Software (for makers)**
- **Why it fails:** Etsy handles sales, accounting software handles money, but nothing manages materials inventory, production timeline, product profitability together.

**The Pattern:**
Existing tools handle ONE piece (budget OR inspiration OR communication) but nothing integrates project management with budget with materials with timeline with collaboration. Nothing works equally well in office (planning), on-site (execution), and in-store (purchasing). Nothing serves partners as equals.

**What Users Actually Need:**
A system **designed for complex projects with multiple moving parts** (not adapted from other uses), **always visible** (command center at home), **always accessible** (mobile at store/on-site), **partner collaboration** (both users have equal access), **budget transparency** (real-time spending visibility), **documentation** (photos, receipts, decisions), and **prevents disasters** (alerts, timeline, profitability tracking).
