-----

## Target Audience

### Who Will Buy This Product

**Professional event coordinators managing 3-8 simultaneous events**

**Primary Demographics:**

- **Professional Event Planners**: Wedding planners, corporate event coordinators, party planners (ages 28-45)
- **Venue Managers**: Coffee shops, galleries, community centers, libraries coordinating recurring programming (ages 25-50)
- **Corporate/Organizational Coordinators**: HR professionals running training, education coordinators managing professional development (ages 30-50)
- **Personal Event Planners** (Secondary): Individuals planning major life events while working full-time (ages 25-40)

**Income**: $35,000-$100,000+ (varies by role)
**Location**: Urban and suburban areas
**Context**: Full-time event professionals OR people with event coordination as part of broader role

### How They Think and Feel

- Detail-oriented but overwhelmed by volume of moving parts
- Pride themselves on flawless execution and client/attendee experience
- Frustrated by scattered information across emails, spreadsheets, vendor communications
- Anxious about forgetting critical details or missing vendor deadlines
- Value systems that prevent disasters before they happen
- Want to look professional and organized to clients/attendees/stakeholders
- Juggling multiple events at different planning stages simultaneously
- Feel like they're always one missed detail away from catastrophe

### What Frustrates Them (In Their Own Words)

- "I'm managing five events at different stages - one forgotten vendor confirmation could ruin everything"
- "Information is buried in email threads - I waste hours finding what I need"
- "I can't see across all my events to know which one needs attention right now"
- "Day-of coordination is chaos - my timeline is in three different places"
- "Clients ask 'what's the status?' and I have to open five spreadsheets to answer"
- "I've hit my capacity limit - I can't take more events with my current system"
- "Wedding planning apps only handle ONE event - useless when I'm coordinating ten"

### Current Behavior

**What they use now**:

- Spreadsheets for timeline and vendor tracking (becomes overwhelming with multiple events)
- Physical binders or folders per event (can't see across events easily)
- Email chains with vendors (information buried, hard to find)
- Separate tools for budget tracking, vendor communication, timeline management, checklists
- Wedding planning apps (The Knot, WeddingWire) - only work for one event
- Project management tools (Asana, Monday) - not designed for event-specific needs

**Why these fail**:

- Can't see all events at once
- No cross-event conflict detection
- Don't sync to mobile for on-site coordination
- Not built for event-specific workflows (day-of timelines, vendor coordination)
- No client/vendor portal sharing
- Everything requires manual updates

### What They're Looking For

- ONE system to see all events and their status at a glance
- Clear view of which event needs attention this week
- Vendor/participant coordination without email archaeology
- Day-of timeline accessible on phone during event execution
- Prevention of double-booking venues or resources
- Professional way to share event details with clients/attendees
- System that catches what they're about to forget
- Ability to template recurring events (don't rebuild every time)

## Company Background

### About EventPro Inc.

EventPro was founded in 2021 by **Alicia Morrison**, who spent eight years as the events manager for a mid-sized community arts center in Portland. In that role, Alicia coordinated everything from gallery openings and concerts to workshops, fundraisers, and private rentals—often managing 15-20 events per month at various stages of planning.

### The Origin Story

The breaking point came during a particularly chaotic week in spring 2019. Alicia was coordinating a major fundraising gala, a weekly open mic series, two private wedding rentals, and a multi-day conference—all happening within a 10-day window. She had spreadsheets, binders, email threads, and sticky notes covering every surface of her desk.

On the day of the gala, she discovered the caterer had the wrong setup time because an email update had gotten buried. The florist showed up an hour late because Alicia had forgotten to send the revised timeline. The AV tech was confused about equipment needs because the information was in three different places. The event ultimately succeeded, but it took years off Alicia's life and made her look disorganized to her board of directors.

That's when she realized: the problem wasn't her organizational skills—it was that event coordination tools were designed for people planning ONE big event (like a wedding), not for people managing MULTIPLE overlapping events simultaneously.

### Mission

Enable flawless multi-event execution by making overlapping chaos visible and manageable.

### Core Philosophy

Alicia's philosophy: "You're not scattered. You're managing ten different events that each have fifty moving parts. That's not a you problem—that's a tools problem. EventPro makes the chaos visible so nothing falls through the cracks."

-----

## Brand Personality

EventPro is the experienced coordinator who stays calm when everything's happening at once.

### Brand Voice

- **Professional and competent** (builds trust with clients and stakeholders)
- **Calm under pressure** (not frantic or stressed - the tool provides calm in chaos)
- **Practical and realistic** about event coordination reality
- **"We understand multi-event coordination" credibility**
- **Confident about preventing disasters**
- **Supportive without being condescending**
- **Built by someone who actually did this work** (not consultants theorizing)

### Visual Identity Direction (Your Job to Develop)

Should feel:

- Professional enough for corporate clients to see
- Organized and systematic (conveys control and competence)
- Modern but approachable (not cold or sterile)
- Works across event types (weddings, corporate, community programming)
- Conveys reliability and attention to detail
- Appeals to both creative event planners and operational coordinators

### Not This

- **Wedding-specific aesthetic** (too narrow, excludes other users)
- **Chaotic/creative/whimsical** (undermines organization message)
- **Corporate productivity culture** (too stiff for creative events industry)
- **Party/celebration aesthetic** (trivializes professional event management)
- **Overly minimalist** (doesn't communicate comprehensive tool)

-----

## What This Campaign Needs to Do

**Main goal:**
Position EventPro as the essential coordination system for anyone managing multiple events simultaneously.

**How to do that:**

1. **Build Professional Credibility Across Event Types**
   - Must work for wedding planners AND corporate coordinators AND venue managers
   - Visual identity can't skew too "wedding" or too "corporate"
   - Conveys serious professional tool, not consumer app
   - Clients/attendees should be impressed when they see shared event details

2. **Address Multi-Event Chaos**
   - Single-event tools don't work for people managing 5-10 simultaneous events
   - Branding must communicate: handles complexity, prevents disasters
   - Focus on "see all your events, know what needs attention"
   - Acknowledge reality of overlapping timelines without dwelling on stress

3. **Differentiate from Spreadsheets and Single-Event Tools**
   - Many coordinators currently use Excel or Google Sheets—why switch?
   - Wedding planning apps don't handle multiple events
   - Project management tools aren't designed for event-specific needs
   - Physical + digital = always visible command center, prevents forgetting

4. **Appeal to Multiple User Types**
   - Professional event planners (primary market)
   - Venue managers (recurring programming)
   - Corporate coordinators (conferences, training)
   - Personal event planners (secondary market)
   - Show versatility without being generic

5. **Position as Business/Professional Investment**
   - This costs money—justify the value
   - ROI: prevented disasters, saved time, professional client impression
   - Prevents reputation damage from missed details
   - "Prevents one vendor disaster and it's paid for itself"

-----

## Brand Positioning

**Position:** The multi-event command center that prevents coordination disasters by making overlapping chaos visible and manageable.

### Key Messages

**For Professional Event Coordinators:**

- "See all your events at a glance—know what needs attention now"
- "Stop losing vendor details in email threads"
- "Manage multiple events without the mental overwhelm"
- "Built by someone who coordinated 20 events per month"
- "One missed detail can ruin an event—EventPro catches what you're about to forget"

**For Venue Managers:**

- "Coordinate recurring programming without rebuilding schedules every time"
- "Prevent double-booking conflicts before they happen"
- "Share event details with performers and participants effortlessly"

**For Organizations:**

- "Manage conferences, training sessions, and programming from one system"
- "Professional event coordination without event planning expertise"

### What EventPro Is NOT

- Not a wedding planning app (too narrow—handles any event type)
- Not a project management tool adapted for events (built for events specifically)
- Not consumer party-planning software (professional-grade tool)
- Not single-event focused (designed for managing multiple simultaneous events)

-----

## Why This Matters for Event Coordinators

### The Current Problem: Single-Event Tools for Multi-Event Reality

Most event coordination tools are designed for someone planning ONE big event (their wedding, one conference). But professional coordinators, venue managers, and organizational staff manage 5-15 events simultaneously at different planning stages: next week's gallery opening (final details), next month's corporate retreat (vendor confirmations), next quarter's fundraising gala (early planning).

**Current reality**:

- Spreadsheets per event (can't see across events)
- Email threads with vendors (information buried)
- Physical binders (live at desk, not accessible on-site)
- Separate budget tracking (disconnected from planning)
- Mental load of "which event needs attention today?"
- No system shows ALL events and their status at once

**What breaks**:

- Forgot to confirm vendor for Event A because focused on Event B crisis
- Double-booked venue because didn't see conflict across events
- Missed budget overrun on Event C until too late
- Day-of timeline fell apart because information scattered across emails and notes
- Looked disorganized to client because couldn't quickly answer "what's the status?"

### How EventPro's Features Address This

**Multi-Event Visual Command Center**

The display board shows all active events color-coded by pin. Before your day starts, you see: Blue Event (wedding Saturday) needs final vendor confirmations this week, Green Event (corporate training Thursday) has budget overrun, Yellow Event (monthly open mic Friday) is on track. You know exactly where to focus attention without opening five different spreadsheets.

**Prevents Coordination Disasters**

Timeline management with vendor coordination means everyone knows who should be where when. Day-of timeline accessible on phone during event execution. Update in real-time if caterer's late—everyone sees adjusted schedule immediately. Client/vendor portal shares timeline automatically—no manual "here's the updated schedule" emails.

**Handles Recurring Events Efficiently**

Venue managers running monthly open mics, weekly workshops, or seasonal programming can save successful events as templates. Next month's open mic starts with last month's timeline, vendor list, and checklist—adjust specifics, don't rebuild from scratch every time.

**Budget Protection Across Events**

Track estimated vs. actual costs per event. System alerts when Event A's florals are 20% over budget while you're focused on Event B. See total committed costs across all active events to understand cash flow and capacity.

**Professional Client Experience**

Share event portal with couple planning wedding, corporate client booking conference, or community members attending workshop. They see their event timeline, vendor status, and planning progress without seeing your other events. Look organized and professional without doing extra work.

**Resource Conflict Prevention**

Managing multiple events in same venue or with shared resources (AV equipment, staff, vehicles)? EventPro prevents double-booking. Alerts when you're about to schedule Event A's setup during Event B's teardown in same space.

**Mobile + Physical = Complete Coverage**

Physical board in office for planning and oversight. Mobile app for vendor calls, on-site event coordination, quick updates between events. Never disconnected from your event portfolio.

**Different from Single-Event Apps and Spreadsheets**

Wedding planning apps (The Knot, WeddingWire) only handle one event—useless if you're coordinating ten events. Spreadsheets can't show cross-event conflicts, don't sync to mobile, require manual updates. Project management tools (Asana, Monday) aren't built for event-specific needs like day-of timelines, vendor coordination, or client portals. EventPro is purpose-built for managing multiple simultaneous events with event-specific workflows.

# PART 3: USER RESEARCH

*Use this section to understand the emotional context and real needs of your audience.*

-----

## User Stories

These are real examples from event coordinators who need EventPro. These stories help you understand who you're designing for and what problems they face.

### User Story 1: Maya—The Wedding Planner Juggling Five Ceremonies

**Background:**

Maya is a 34-year-old professional wedding planner running her own boutique wedding planning business for six years. She typically manages 4-6 weddings simultaneously at different planning stages—some couples are 12 months out (early planning), others are 3 months away (vendor finalizations), one wedding is this Saturday (execution mode). She works from a home office and is on-site for events on weekends. Her business depends on flawless execution and word-of-mouth referrals.

**Current System:**

Maya uses a combination of Google Sheets (timeline and vendor tracking per wedding), physical binders (contracts and notes per couple), Gmail (all vendor communication), QuickBooks (invoicing and budget tracking), and a massive wall calendar showing all wedding dates. She creates detailed day-of timelines in Word documents. She uses her phone for everything during actual wedding days.

**Pain Points:**

- Context-switching between weddings is mentally exhausting—she'll be finalizing Couple A's catering, then Couple B calls about florals, then she realizes she forgot to confirm photographer for Couple C
- She missed a vendor deadline for one wedding because she was in crisis mode with another wedding that weekend
- During a wedding last month, the florist showed up an hour late because Maya had emailed an updated timeline but the florist didn't see it in their inbox chaos
- Couples ask "what's the status on X?" and Maya has to open three different files to answer
- She can't see budget status across all weddings—discovered one wedding was 25% over budget only when doing month-end reconciliation
- Day-of timelines are in Word docs on her laptop—had to pull over while driving to venue to check vendor arrival time
- She's considering turning down new clients because managing five weddings simultaneously feels like her maximum capacity

**Quote:**

*"I love creating beautiful weddings, but I'm drowning in coordination. I have five couples, each with 15-20 vendors, each wedding with 50+ moving parts. That's hundreds of details I'm tracking across spreadsheets and email and notes. One forgotten vendor confirmation or one missed timeline update can ruin someone's wedding day. I need to see all my weddings at once and know immediately what needs my attention today."*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board in home office shows all five weddings color-coded: see at a glance which weddings have urgent tasks this week
- By Event view: click Wedding A, see all their vendors, timeline, budget, tasks—instant context without opening five spreadsheets
- Vendor communication log: searchable record of all conversations with Couple B's florist—no email archaeology
- Budget tracking alerts: "Wedding C is 20% over budget" notification before it becomes crisis
- Mobile timeline access: day-of schedule for Saturday's wedding accessible on phone during event—update in real-time if vendor late
- Shared couple portals: couples see their wedding timeline and vendor status without manual updates from Maya
- Capacity planning: see total workload across all five weddings to evaluate if she can take Wedding #6

**Design Takeaway:**

Your brand must communicate **handles multiple events without dropping details**. Maya is competent but at capacity. Messaging around "see all your events," "never miss a vendor deadline," and "flawless execution" will resonate. Visual metaphors of command center, overview, and control.

### User Story 2: James—The Community Center Event Manager

**Background:**

James is a 29-year-old events coordinator for a mid-sized community center in a suburban area. He manages 15-20 events per month including recurring programming (weekly yoga classes, monthly art receptions, twice-monthly film screenings) and one-time rentals (birthday parties, small weddings, corporate meetings). Events range from 10 to 200 attendees. He works in a small office at the center and is on-site for most events. His role is 50% event coordination, 50% community outreach and marketing.

**Current System:**

James uses a massive Google Sheet with all events, a physical wall calendar in his office showing bookings, Gmail for all participant/vendor communication, and individual Google Docs for each event's timeline and checklist. He tracks payments and deposits in a separate spreadsheet. He posts event information to the center's website manually.

**Pain Points:**

- He double-booked the main hall twice this year because his spreadsheet didn't flag the conflict—had to scramble to move one event to smaller room (embarrassing)
- Recurring events require rebuilding schedules every time: monthly film screening has same basic structure but he recreates timeline and vendor list each month
- A yoga instructor asked "what time do I have access for setup?" and James had to search through three months of emails to find the original conversation
- During last month's art reception, the catering arrived 30 minutes late because James had verbally updated the time but never sent written confirmation
- He can't quickly see "which events this month are over budget vs. under budget"—discovers budget issues only when reconciling at month-end
- Community members attending workshops ask "what's on the schedule?" and James types up event info manually for each inquiry
- He's on-site for events but his timeline and checklist live in Google Docs on his laptop—can't easily access from phone while setting up

**Quote:**

*"I'm coordinating 20 events at different stages constantly. This week I've got final details for Saturday's wedding rental, setup for tonight's film screening, and early planning for next month's fundraiser. I need to template our recurring events so I'm not rebuilding the same yoga class schedule every week, and I need to stop double-booking the venue because I didn't see the conflict in my spreadsheet. I feel like I'm always one step behind."*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board shows all 15-20 active events: instantly see which events are this week vs. next month, which need attention
- Recurring event templates: save "Monthly Film Screening" template with standard timeline, vendor list, checklist—next month's screening starts pre-populated
- Venue conflict detection: system alerts when James tries to book event in main hall already reserved for different event
- Searchable communication log: "What did yoga instructor say about setup time?" answered in 10 seconds instead of email searching
- Mobile timeline access: tonight's film screening checklist accessible on phone during setup
- Event portal for community: share upcoming workshop schedule, attendees RSVP directly without emailing James
- Budget tracking across all events: see which events are trending over/under budget at a glance

**Design Takeaway:**

Your brand must communicate **efficiency for high-volume recurring programming**. James manages many events but they're smaller scale than weddings. Messaging around "template recurring events," "prevent double-booking," and "stop rebuilding schedules" will resonate. Visual identity should work for community/cultural organizations, not just high-end events.

### User Story 3: Priya—The Corporate Training Coordinator

**Background:**

Priya is a 42-year-old learning and development coordinator for a regional healthcare organization with 800 employees. She manages all employee training, professional development sessions, new hire onboarding, and mandatory compliance training. She coordinates 8-12 training events per month ranging from 2-hour workshops to 3-day conferences. Events happen at main office, satellite locations, and occasionally external venues. She works with external facilitators, internal subject matter experts, and manages registration for all sessions.

**Current System:**

Priya uses Outlook calendar for event dates, Excel spreadsheets for registration tracking and vendor management, email for all facilitator communication, and PowerPoint for creating session agendas. She creates printed handouts with schedules for each training session. Her organization uses an LMS (learning management system) for course content but not for event logistics.

**Pain Points:**

- She's coordinating fall professional development days (3 full days, 40+ sessions, 15 external facilitators) while also managing weekly new hire orientation and monthly compliance training—can't see across all events easily
- Registration tracking is manual in spreadsheet—doesn't know if sessions are at capacity until she manually counts
- Last month's leadership training: facilitator asked "where do I send my invoice?" and Priya had to search emails for contract details
- Day-of PD sessions: printed schedule had wrong room number for afternoon session because Priya updated digital version but didn't reprint
- She forgot to confirm AV equipment for satellite location training until day before—nearly caused disaster
- Employees ask "what's the agenda for next week's workshop?" and Priya emails agenda individually instead of having shareable link
- Budget tracking across all training events is done monthly in retrospect—can't proactively manage spending

**Quote:**

*"I'm managing 10-12 training events at any given time, from small workshops to large conferences with hundreds of attendees. Between vendor coordination, registration tracking, facility logistics, and materials preparation, I have a million details to track. I need one system where I can see: which events are this month, who's registered, which facilitators need follow-up, what's the budget status. Right now I'm in five different tools and I'm terrified I'm going to forget something critical."*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Display board shows all training events: see fall PD days (Blue), weekly orientations (Green), monthly compliance (Yellow) simultaneously
- Task breakdown: break 3-day PD conference into phases (registration, facilitator confirmations, materials prep, venue setup, day-of execution)
- Facilitator coordination: contact info, contracts, communication log, deliverable status all in one place per event
- Registration tracking: see capacity per session, waitlist management
- Shared event portals: employees access workshop agendas and schedules via link—no manual emails
- Budget tracking per event: see spending across all events, get alerts when event trending over budget
- Mobile day-of access: full schedule and checklist accessible on phone during multi-day conference
- Template recurring events: monthly compliance training starts with established structure, adjust specifics

**Design Takeaway:**

Your brand must communicate **professional coordination for organizational events**. Priya needs serious business tool, not wedding aesthetic. Messaging around "manage complex multi-day events," "registration tracking," and "never miss facilitator deadline" will resonate. Visual identity must work in corporate/organizational contexts.

### User Story 4: Sophie—Planning Her Own Wedding While Working Full-Time

**Background:**

Sophie is a 28-year-old marketing manager planning her wedding for next June (8 months away). She's working full-time while coordinating the wedding herself—she considered hiring a planner but decided to save the $3,000-5,000 cost and do it herself. She's organized by nature but has never planned an event of this scale. She's managing 12 vendors (venue, caterer, photographer, DJ, florist, baker, rentals, etc.) and a budget of $35,000.

**Current System:**

Sophie uses a wedding planning app (The Knot), Google Sheets for budget tracking, a physical binder with contracts and magazine clippings, email for all vendor communication, and Pinterest for inspiration. She has a running note in her phone with her to-do list. She meets with vendors on evenings and weekends around her full-time work schedule.

**Pain Points:**

- The Knot app is great for inspiration and checklists but doesn't help her coordinate 12 different vendors with different timelines and deliverables
- She's tracking vendor payments in Google Sheets but it's disconnected from her planning—she missed a deposit deadline last month
- Vendor communication is scattered across email threads—when her mom asked "what time is the photographer arriving?" Sophie spent 15 minutes finding the email
- She's anxious about the day-of timeline: she's created a schedule in Google Docs but how does she share it with all vendors and wedding party?
- She can't visualize "what needs to happen this month vs. next month"—everything feels urgent
- Her fiancé asks "what's the status on X?" and Sophie has to check three different places to answer
- She's losing sleep worrying she's forgetting something important

**Quote:**

*"Planning a wedding while working full-time is so much harder than I expected. I have 12 vendors, a million decisions to make, and I'm terrified I'm going to forget something important. The wedding apps are good for checklists and inspiration but they don't actually help me coordinate all these vendors and manage the timeline. I need something that shows me: what needs to happen this week, which vendors I need to follow up with, and helps me create a day-of timeline that I can actually share with everyone."*

**How EventPro Helps:**

- Single event view optimized for deep focus: all wedding tasks, vendors, timeline, budget in one visual system
- Vendor management: track all 12 vendors, their deliverables, payment status, communication history
- Budget tracking: see estimated vs. actual spending in real-time, alerts when approaching budget limits
- Task breakdown: overwhelming wedding planning → manageable monthly phases → weekly tasks
- Timeline creation: build minute-by-minute day-of schedule, share with all vendors and wedding party via portal
- Shared portal: vendors and wedding party access timeline and details—no more "what time should I arrive?" emails
- Mobile access: wedding timeline accessible on phone during actual wedding day
- Peace of mind: visual confirmation that nothing's forgotten, everything's tracked

**Design Takeaway:**

Your brand must work for **personal event planning** as secondary market. Sophie isn't a professional but needs professional-grade coordination. Messaging around "coordinate complex events even if you're not a professional planner" and "stop worrying you've forgotten something" will resonate. Visual identity shouldn't be so corporate it alienates personal users.

## Current Behaviors & Why Existing Solutions Fail

### What Event Coordinators Currently Use

**Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)**

- **Why it fails:** Can't see across multiple events easily. No mobile access during events. Doesn't sync. Manual updates. No vendor collaboration. No timeline visualization. Becomes overwhelming with many events.

**Wedding Planning Apps (The Knot, WeddingWire, Zola)**

- **Why it fails:** Designed for one event only. Useless for professionals managing 5-10 events. Consumer-focused, not professional-grade. Limited vendor coordination. Can't template recurring events.

**Project Management Tools (Asana, Monday, Trello)**

- **Why it fails:** Not designed for event-specific workflows (day-of timelines, vendor coordination). Steep learning curve. No client/attendee portals. Overkill for simple events, insufficient for complex multi-event management.

**Email + Calendar**

- **Why it fails:** Vendor communication buried in threads. Can't find past conversations. Calendar shows when, not what/who/how. No budget tracking. Information scattered. No collaboration.

**Event Management Software (Cvent, Eventbrite)**

- **Why it fails:** Designed for large conferences/ticketed events. Expensive. Overkill for small events. Complex setup. Registration-focused, not coordination-focused.

**Physical Binders/Folders**

- **Why it fails:** Lives at desk, not accessible on-site. Can't see across multiple events. No search. No alerts. Can't share with vendors/clients. Static.

**Combination of Multiple Tools**

- **Why it fails:** Budget in QuickBooks, timeline in Word, vendor list in Excel, communication in email, inspiration in Pinterest. Nothing talks to each other. Increases cognitive load rather than reducing it.

### The Pattern

Single-event tools don't scale to multiple simultaneous events. Spreadsheets can't handle coordination complexity. Project management tools aren't event-specific. Nothing provides ambient awareness of multi-event status. Nothing integrates planning, coordination, budget, and client communication. Nothing works as well in office (planning) as on-site (execution).

### What Event Coordinators Actually Need

A system **designed for managing multiple events simultaneously** (not adapted from single-event or generic project tools), **always visible** (command center view of all events), **always accessible** (mobile during on-site coordination), **event-specific workflows** (timelines, vendor management, day-of execution), **client/vendor collaboration** (share details without email), and **prevents disasters** (conflict detection, deadline alerts, budget warnings).

# PART 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

*This section bridges your creative vision to the technical platform being built by programming students.*

-----

## Overview: Design Meets Development

EventPro is one of six white-label applications built on the **Task Management Platform™**, a flexible system developed by programming students in CSC 289. Understanding how your design choices translate to platform capabilities helps you create implementation-aware, realistic designs.

**The core insight:** EventPro, FamilyHub, StudyStream, FreelanceFlow, RenovateRight, and TeamFlow™ all use the same database, task logic, and core features. What makes EventPro distinct is the terminology, visual design, and feature emphasis you create—not custom code.

**Why this matters for designers:**

- Your color palette becomes CSS variables programmers can implement
- Your terminology choices map to configuration files
- Your interface mockups guide actual screen development
- Your brand personality influences notification language and user flow

This isn't theoretical. Programming students may implement your EventPro theme as a demonstration of the platform's white-label flexibility. Understanding the technical foundation helps you design within realistic constraints while pushing creative boundaries.

-----

## 5.1 Engine Capability Mapping

### How EventPro Features Map to Task Management Platform Capabilities

The Task Management Platform provides robust task coordination infrastructure. EventPro doesn't require custom programming—it reconfigures and reframes existing capabilities through event-specific design.

#### Task Management → Event Coordination

**Platform capability:** CRUD operations for tasks with assignment, due dates, priorities, status tracking, and project organization.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Task = **Event Task** or **Action Item** (vendor call, deadline item, day-of timeline item)
- Standard task fields (title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, project) remain at database level
- Additional metadata for event context:
  - `event_id` (which event this task belongs to)
  - `vendor_id` (which vendor this involves, if applicable)
  - `event_phase` (planning, prep, day-of, post-event)
  - `timeline_position` (minute-by-minute placement for day-of execution)
  - `budget_item_id` (links to budget tracking)
  - `client_visible` (boolean: should client see this in portal)

**Design implications:**

- Every task display must show WHICH EVENT it belongs to (color-coding essential)
- Priority language shifts from generic to event-specific ("This Week" / "Day-Of Urgent" / "Post-Event")
- Status language shifts from corporate to event-friendly ("Not Started" / "Confirmed" / "Complete" / "N/A")
- Task creation should feel event-aware (quick assignment to events, vendors, timeline positions)

#### Project Organization → Events

**Platform capability:** Projects group related tasks with hierarchical organization, visual customization (color, icon), and progress tracking.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Projects = **Events** (with event-specific metadata)
- Each event tagged with:
  - `event_type` (wedding, corporate, community, conference, training, etc.)
  - `event_date` (primary temporal marker)
  - `venue` (location information)
  - `client_name` (who's hosting/sponsoring)
  - `budget_total` (estimated total budget)
  - `status` (planning, prep, executing, complete, archived)
  - `color` (visual identifier on multi-event dashboard)
  - `template_source_id` (if created from recurring event template)

**Design implications:**

- Event selector must accommodate diverse event types (wedding, conference, workshop)
- Event colors must be distinct enough for at-a-glance recognition across 8+ simultaneous events
- Event metadata display should prioritize: date, venue, client, status
- Progress visualization: "Timeline 85% complete" / "12 of 15 vendors confirmed" feels professional

#### Category System → Event Organization Schemes

**Platform capability:** Flexible categorization for organizational preferences.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Categories can represent:
  - **Vendor Types** (Venue, Catering, Photography, Entertainment, Florals, etc.)
  - **Event Phases** (Planning, Vendor Coordination, Day-Of, Post-Event)
  - **Locations** (Main Hall, Gallery, Conference Room A, etc.)
  - **Client Departments** (for corporate/organizational coordinators)

**Design implications:**

- Category selector should feel event-industry native (vendor-first thinking)
- Visual representation: vendor categories use industry-recognized icons
- Easy filtering by vendor type across all events ("Show me all photography tasks")

#### Priority System → Event Timeline Urgency

**Platform capability:** Three-tier priority system (low, medium, high) affects sorting and visual emphasis.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Priority renamed for event context:
  - Low → **"When Possible"** or **"Low"** (can wait)
  - Medium → **"This Week"** or **"Soon"** (normal deadline)
  - High → **"Urgent"** or **"Day-Of Critical"** (needs immediate attention)
- Priority affects visual weight but maintains professional tone

**Design implications:**

- Priority indicators should be clear but not alarming (event professionals are already stressed)
- Visual language: color saturation, position in list, or urgency badge
- "Urgent" tasks stand out but don't induce panic (helpful emphasis, not alarm)
- Day-of execution mode: priority becomes timeline position

#### Status Tracking → Event Progress States

**Platform capability:** Task status transitions (To Do, In Progress, Complete, Archived) with timestamp tracking.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Status renamed for event coordination:
  - To Do → **"Not Started"** or **"Pending"**
  - In Progress → **"Confirmed"** or **"In Progress"**
  - Complete → **"Complete"** or **"Done"**
  - Special states: **"Waiting on Vendor"** / **"Client Approval Needed"** / **"N/A"**
- Status transitions create audit trail for accountability

**Design implications:**

- Status change interactions should feel professional (checkmark, status dropdown)
- Completed tasks remain visible but dimmed (coordinator needs to see what's done)
- "Waiting on Vendor" status includes vendor name and last contact timestamp
- Status filtering essential for multi-event view ("Show only incomplete tasks across all events")

#### Conflict Detection → Schedule and Resource Management

**Platform capability (platform-specific feature):** Algorithmic detection of overlapping due dates/times, assignment overload warnings, resource conflicts.

**EventPro implementation:**

- Detects when:
  - Two events scheduled at same venue/time
  - Same vendor assigned to multiple events simultaneously
  - Coordinator assigned to multiple day-of tasks at same time
  - Budget exceeds estimate thresholds
- Professional, solution-oriented alerts—not alarms

**Design implications:**

- Conflict warnings must be noticeable but professional (amber caution, not red panic)
- Notification text: "Event A and Event B both use Main Hall on Saturday 2pm. Adjust one?"
- Visual language: timeline overlap visualization, vendor availability calendar
- Month/week view should visually show event density and potential conflicts
- Warnings appear on both display board and mobile app

#### Recurring Tasks → Event Templates

**Platform capability:** Task recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, custom intervals) with automatic regeneration.

**EventPro mapping:**

- Recurring tasks → **Event Templates**
- Templates capture entire event structure:
  - Standard vendor list
  - Typical timeline
  - Budget categories
  - Checklist items
  - Setup/breakdown tasks
- Next occurrence starts pre-populated, coordinator adjusts specifics

**Design implications:**

- Template library interface: "Monthly Open Mic" / "Weekly Training Session" / "Annual Fundraiser"
- Template creation: "Save this event as template for future use"
- Template application: "Start new event from template" with customization step
- Visual distinction between templated events and one-time events

#### Real-Time Sync → Multi-Device Coordination

**Platform capability:** Database updates trigger real-time synchronization across all connected devices.

**EventPro implementation:**

- Physical display board updates instantly when task added/changed via app
- Mobile app updates instantly when task added/changed on display board
- Client/vendor portal updates reflect coordinator changes immediately
- Visual feedback confirms sync ("saved" indicator, timestamp update)

**Design implications:**

- Loading states must be fast (sync should feel instantaneous)
- Offline mode gracefully handled (changes sync when connection restored)
- Visual confirmation that sync occurred (subtle animation, "last updated" timestamp)
- No confusing "refresh" buttons—updates should just appear

-----

## 5.2 Database Entity Alignment

### How Task Management Platform Database Supports EventPro

The platform uses a relational database schema. EventPro extends base entities with event-specific context fields.

#### Users → Event Coordinators

**Base entity:** User authentication, profile data, workspace membership.

**EventPro extensions:**

- Additional profile fields:
  - `coordinator_type` (wedding planner, venue manager, corporate, freelance)
  - `company_name` (business affiliation)
  - `specializations` (event types: weddings, conferences, corporate, community)
  - `capacity_limit` (max simultaneous events)
  - `notification_preferences` (how much coordinator wants reminders)
  - `timezone` (critical for multi-location events)

**Design implications:**

- User profiles feel professional, business-focused
- Profile setup wizard asks about event coordination specialty
- Settings include capacity management and notification tuning
- Visual representation: professional headshot + company logo

#### Workspaces → Client Portfolios or Venue Programming

**Base entity:** Team/organization container for multi-user collaboration.

**EventPro terminology:**

- Workspace → **Client Portfolio** (for planners managing multiple clients) OR **Venue Programming** (for venue managers)
- One workspace = one coordinator's full event portfolio OR one venue's full calendar
- Team collaboration: coordinator + assistant + venue staff

**Design implications:**

- Workspace setup: "Create Your Event Portfolio" or "Set Up Venue Calendar"
- Workspace settings: client list, venue details, team member roles
- Multi-coordinator workspaces support delegation and collaboration
- Workspace name optional ("Morrison Events" or "Community Arts Center Programming")

#### Projects → Events

**Base entity:** Task organizational containers with name, description, color, icon, status.

**EventPro event-specific fields:**

- Required fields:
  - `event_name` (clear, client-recognizable name)
  - `event_date` (primary temporal marker)
  - `event_type` (wedding, corporate, conference, workshop, etc.)
  - `venue` (location details)
- Optional fields:
  - `client_name` (who's hosting)
  - `client_contact` (email, phone)
  - `guest_count` (estimated attendees)
  - `budget_total` (financial ceiling)
  - `setup_time` / `event_start_time` / `event_end_time` / `breakdown_time`
  - `notes` (special considerations)
- System fields:
  - `color` (visual identifier)
  - `status` (planning, prep, executing, complete, archived)
  - `template_source_id` (if from template)
  - `created_from_template` (boolean)

**Design implications:**

- Event creation form prioritizes: name, date, type, venue (minimal friction)
- Event detail view shows: timeline, budget, vendors, client info, tasks
- Event list view: sortable by date, type, client, status
- Color assignment during creation (coordinator picks from palette)
- Event archiving after completion (keeps history without clutter)

#### Tasks → Event Tasks and Action Items

**Base entity:** Task with title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, project association.

**EventPro extensions:**

- Additional fields:
  - `vendor_id` (which vendor this involves, if applicable)
  - `event_phase` (planning, vendor coordination, day-of execution, post-event)
  - `timeline_position` (minute-by-minute day-of placement: "10:30am - Florist arrives")
  - `budget_item_id` (links to budget line item)
  - `client_visible` (should client see this in shared portal)
  - `estimated_duration` (helps with day-of scheduling)
  - `location_detail` (specific room, loading dock, etc.)
  - `attachment_urls` (contracts, diagrams, floor plans)
- Terminology variants:
  - Planning tasks: "Call caterer for menu consultation"
  - Day-of tasks: "10:30am - Florist setup begins"
  - Post-event tasks: "Send thank-you to vendors"

**Design implications:**

- Task creation form adapts to context (planning vs. day-of)
- Planning tasks: title, due date, vendor, priority
- Day-of tasks: time, title, vendor, location, duration
- Task display shows vendor association prominently
- Client-visible toggle for transparent planning
- Attachment preview for contracts and diagrams

#### Vendors/Contacts → Vendor Management

**EventPro-specific entity** (extends or uses existing contact system):

- Vendor fields:
  - `vendor_name` (business name)
  - `vendor_type` (Venue, Catering, Photography, etc.)
  - `contact_name` (person's name)
  - `contact_email` / `contact_phone`
  - `contract_status` (pending, signed, complete)
  - `payment_status` (deposit paid, balance due, paid in full)
  - `deliverables` (what they're providing)
  - `communication_log` (searchable conversation history)

**Design implications:**

- Vendor directory per event (all vendors for Wedding A)
- Vendor detail view: contact info, contract status, payment tracking, communication history
- Quick-add vendor from task creation
- Vendor type categorization for filtering
- Communication log prevents email archaeology

#### Client/Attendee Portal Access

**EventPro-specific feature** (leverages workspace sharing with limited permissions):

- Portal access:
  - Unique shareable link per event (no account required for clients)
  - Read-only access to: timeline, vendor status, task progress
  - Optional: approval workflows (client approves budget items, vendor choices)
  - Optional: RSVP/registration tracking (for conferences, workshops)

**Design implications:**

- Portal design distinct from coordinator interface (client-facing aesthetic)
- Clear, simple navigation for non-professionals
- Timeline visualization optimized for client understanding
- Approval interface clear and actionable
- Mobile-optimized for on-the-go clients

#### Notifications → Timeline Alerts and Reminders

**Base entity:** Notification system for task assignments, due dates, status changes.

**EventPro adaptation:**

- Notification tone: professional, helpful, calm
- Example notifications:
  - "Reminder: Confirm photographer for Johnson Wedding by Friday"
  - "Budget Alert: Hernandez Conference florals 15% over estimate"
  - "Conflict Detected: Two events booked in Main Hall Saturday 2pm"
  - "Day-Of: Catering setup begins in 30 minutes"
- Notification timing configurable per coordinator
- Visual notifications on display board + push notifications on phones

**Design implications:**

- Notification design must work for both coordinators and clients (different contexts)
- Coordinator notifications: actionable, contextual, professional
- Client notifications: reassuring, informative, non-technical
- Visual: calm color scheme, clear action buttons, dismissible but persistent
- Bulk dismiss option for coordinators managing many events

#### How Developers Use This Configuration

**Terminology replacement throughout application:**

```python
# Example Flask template using configuration
from config import get_brand_config

config = get_brand_config('eventpro')

# In template:
<h1>{{ config.terminology.project_plural }}</h1>
# Renders: <h1>Events</h1>

<p>Manage your {{ config.terminology.workspace_singular }}</p>
# Renders: <p>Manage your Portfolio</p>
```

**Color theming via CSS variables:**

```css
/* Generated from EventPro configuration */
:root {
  --color-primary: #2C5F8D;
  --color-secondary: #E8A03D;
  --color-accent: #5C9F6F;

  --color-priority-low: #95A5A6;
  --color-priority-medium: #E8A03D;
  --color-priority-high: #D4716E;

  --color-status-confirmed: #5C9F6F;

  --font-heading: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
  --font-body: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

.event-card.high-priority {
  border-left: 4px solid var(--color-priority-high);
}

.task-confirmed {
  color: var(--color-status-confirmed);
}
```

**Notification message generation:**

```javascript
// Example React component using configuration
import brandConfig from '@/config/brands/eventpro.json';

function ConflictNotification({ conflictDescription }) {
  const message = brandConfig.notification_messages.conflict_detected;

  return (
    <div className="notification warning">
      <h3>{message.title}</h3>
      <p>{message.body.replace('{conflict_description}', conflictDescription)}</p>
      <button>Review and Adjust</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Component Library Expectations

Developers benefit from a **design system** documenting reusable components. EventPro component library should include:

**Core Components:**

1. **Buttons**
   - Primary (main actions: "Add Event", "Confirm Vendor")
   - Secondary (neutral actions: "Cancel", "View Details")
   - Success (completion: "Mark Complete")
   - Caution (conflicts: "Review Conflict")
   - Sizes: small, medium, large
   - States: default, hover, active, disabled

2. **Event Cards**
   - Event summary card (multi-event dashboard display)
   - Event detail card (expanded view with timeline, budget, vendors)
   - Template event card (recurring event identifier)
   - Conflict warning card (schedule overlap alert)
   - Archived event card (completed event styling)

3. **Task Cards**
   - Planning task card (standard task display)
   - Day-of timeline item card (minute-by-minute execution)
   - Vendor task card (shows vendor association)
   - Client-visible task card (portal styling)
   - Overdue task card (gentle reminder styling)

4. **Vendor Indicators**
   - Vendor card (contact info, status, payment tracking)
   - Vendor category badge (icon + label)
   - Vendor status indicator (confirmed, pending, waiting)
   - Quick-add vendor interface

5. **Notifications/Alerts**
   - Timeline reminder (calm, professional)
   - Conflict warning (helpful problem-solving)
   - Budget alert (informative, non-judgmental)
   - Vendor confirmation reminder (professional)
   - Day-of timeline update (execution support)

6. **Form Elements**
   - Event creation form (name, date, type, venue)
   - Task creation form (planning vs. day-of variants)
   - Vendor management form (contact, contract, payment)
   - Budget tracking form (estimates vs. actuals)
   - Timeline builder (drag-and-drop day-of schedule)

7. **Calendar & Timeline Views**
   - Month calendar (event density visualization, conflict indicators)
   - Week view (detailed multi-event schedule)
   - Day-of timeline (minute-by-minute execution view)
   - Event list view (all events sortable/filterable)

8. **Progress Visualizations**
   - Event completion percentage (timeline, vendor confirmations, budget status)
   - Multi-event overview ("5 events this month, 2 need attention")
   - Budget tracking (estimated vs. actual spending)

**Component Documentation Format:**

Each component documented with:

- **Visual example** (screenshot or live preview)
- **Usage guidelines** (when to use this component)
- **Anatomy** (labeled diagram of component parts)
- **Specifications** (dimensions, spacing, typography, colors)
- **States** (default, hover, active, disabled, error, success, conflict)
- **Responsive behavior** (mobile vs. tablet vs. desktop vs. display board)
- **Accessibility notes** (professional readability, touch-friendly for on-site use)

**Delivery format options:**

- **Figma component library** (preferred for web-based handoff)
- **Adobe XD component library** (if Adobe workflow)
- **PDF design system documentation** (static reference)

#### Handoff Tools and Process

**Recommended handoff platforms:**

1. **Figma (preferred):**
   - Share link to Figma file with developer permissions
   - Use Figma Inspect mode for CSS extraction
   - Organize frames by screen/component (Dashboard, Event Detail, Timeline, Vendor Management)
   - Include annotations for interactions (conflict detection flow, day-of timeline updates)
   - Export assets directly from Figma

2. **Zeplin:**
   - Upload designs from Figma/Sketch
   - Automatic CSS generation
   - Asset export in multiple formats
   - Comment and annotation tools

**Handoff checklist:**

- [ ] All screens designed at standard breakpoints (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1440px, display board 1200x1600px portrait)
- [ ] Interactive states documented (hover, focus, active, disabled, confirmed, conflict)
- [ ] Event color-coding system clear (8 event color options)
- [ ] Vendor category visual system complete
- [ ] Typography specs complete (professional, readable hierarchy)
- [ ] Icons exported as SVG with proper naming
- [ ] Logos exported in multiple formats
- [ ] Component library documented
- [ ] Client portal variations shown (simplified client-facing aesthetic)
- [ ] Physical board interface mockups provided
- [ ] Conflict detection UI designed (helpful warnings, solution-oriented)

**Communication protocol:**

- **Week 2:** Initial design direction shared (mood boards, color explorations, event color palette)
- **Week 4:** Wireframes and component architecture (event cards, timeline layouts, vendor management)
- **Week 6:** High-fidelity designs and component library (full interface mockups, client portal design)
- **Week 8:** Final assets delivered, handoff meeting scheduled
- **Week 10+:** Designer available for implementation questions

## 5.5 API Integration Points

### Where Design Touches Code: UI Components and Data Requirements

EventPro interface components consume data from backend APIs. Understanding these integration points helps designers create realistic, implementable interfaces.

#### Dashboard Components and Data Requirements

**Event Dashboard:** Primary landing page showing all active events and what needs attention.

**Components:**

1. **All Events Overview Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/events/active?workspace_id={id}`
   - **Response:** `{ events: [{ id, name, date, type, venue, client, color, status, tasks_pending, budget_status }] }`
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when events added/updated
   - **Design considerations:** Color-coded event cards, sortable by date, filterable by type, quick "view details" action

2. **This Week Tasks Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/tasks/this-week?workspace_id={id}`
   - **Response:** Array of tasks across all events due within 7 days
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when tasks added/completed
   - **Design considerations:** Grouped by event (color-coded), sortable by due date, shows vendor association

3. **Conflict Warnings Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/conflicts/active`
   - **Response:** Array of scheduling conflicts with descriptions and affected events/vendors
   - **Update frequency:** Real-time when events/tasks scheduled
   - **Design considerations:** Gold/coral alert styling, actionable ("Reschedule" or "Adjust" button), shows both conflicting events clearly

4. **Budget Alerts Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/budget/alerts?workspace_id={id}`
   - **Response:** `{ alerts: [{ event_id, event_name, category, estimated, actual, variance_percentage }] }`
   - **Update frequency:** On budget updates
   - **Design considerations:** Informative (not judgmental), shows estimated vs. actual, link to budget detail view

5. **Vendor Status Widget**
   - **Data source:** `GET /api/vendors/status-summary`
   - **Response:** Summary of vendor confirmations, pending contracts, payment status
   - **Update frequency:** On vendor status changes
   - **Design considerations:** Grouped by status (pending, confirmed, waiting), shows which events, quick-contact actions

**Loading states:** All dashboard components must handle:

- Initial load (skeleton screens or professional loading animation)
- Empty state (encouraging message: "No conflicts detected. Everything on track!")
- Error state ("Couldn't load events right now. Retrying...")

#### Event Detail View UI

**Event detail screen:** Comprehensive view of single event with timeline, vendors, budget, tasks.

**API endpoint:** `GET /api/events/{id}/details`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "event_id": 42,
  "event_name": "Johnson Wedding",
  "event_date": "2026-06-15",
  "event_type": "Wedding",
  "venue": "Portland Art Museum",
  "client_name": "Sarah & Michael Johnson",
  "client_contact": "sarah.johnson@email.com",
  "guest_count": 150,
  "budget_total": 35000,
  "budget_spent": 28500,
  "color": "#D4716E",
  "status": "prep",
  "vendors": [
    {
      "vendor_id": 12,
      "vendor_name": "Culinary Artistry Catering",
      "vendor_type": "Catering",
      "contact_name": "Chef Maria",
      "contact_phone": "503-555-0123",
      "contract_status": "signed",
      "payment_status": "deposit_paid"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": 89,
      "title": "Final menu tasting with couple",
      "due_date": "2026-05-15",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "pending",
      "vendor_id": 12,
      "client_visible": true
    }
  ],
  "timeline": [
    {
      "timeline_item_id": 34,
      "time": "10:00",
      "title": "Venue access for setup",
      "duration_minutes": 60,
      "location": "Main Hall"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design requirements:**

- Event header: name, date, venue, client, status
- Tabbed interface: Overview / Timeline / Vendors / Budget / Tasks
- Color indicator consistent throughout (event color from dashboard)
- Quick actions: "Share with Client", "Edit Event", "View Conflicts"
- Mobile-optimized for on-site access

#### Task Creation and Assignment UI

**Quick-add task form:** Fast task creation from any view.

**API endpoint:** `POST /api/tasks`

**Request payload:**

```json
{
  "title": "Confirm final guest count with venue",
  "event_id": 42,
  "vendor_id": 8,

# PART 6: CROSS-DISCIPLINE WORKFLOW

*This section explains how design and programming students collaborate throughout the semester.*

-----

## Overview: How Design and Development Teams Work Together

EventPro succeeds through coordinated effort between design students (creating brand identity and user experience) and programming students (building the Task Management Platform). Neither discipline works in isolation—designers need technical constraints, developers need visual specifications.

The collaboration teaches real-world interdisciplinary communication while producing better outcomes for both groups.

-----

## Sprint-by-Sprint Collaboration Touchpoints

**Context:** Design students complete their work in 8 weeks. Programming students work in 8 two-week sprints (16 weeks total). Maximum collaboration occurs Weeks 1-8 when both teams are active.

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation Phase (Design + Dev Active)

**Design activities:**

- User authentication implementation
- Basic workspace (portfolio/venue calendar) and user (coordinator) CRUD
- Project architecture decisions

**Collaboration touchpoints:**

- **Week 1 Joint Kickoff:** Teams meet to discuss EventPro concept
  - Designers present target audience research (event coordinator pain points, multi-event chaos)
  - Developers explain platform capabilities (task management, projects, real-time sync, conflict detection)
  - Establish communication channels (Discord, Slack, shared doc)
  - Clarify terminology: "tasks" vs. "action items," "projects" vs. "events," "vendors" vs. "contacts"

- **Week 2 Check-in:** Designers share mood boards, developers share data model
  - Designers: "What data will event coordinators and clients see?"
  - Developers: "Can we detect venue/vendor conflicts? Can we track budgets per event?"
  - Document answers for both teams

**What designers need from developers:**

## Maintaining Professional Collaboration Tone

EventPro is a genuine professional tool for event coordinators—not a satirical corporate product. Collaboration should reflect this professionalism while maintaining warmth and mutual respect.

### Example Email Exchanges

**From designer to developer:**

> Subject: EventPro Conflict Detection Interface Question
>
> Hi [Developer Name],
>
> I'm working on the EventPro conflict detection interface and have a few questions about what's technically possible:
>
> 1. Can we show both conflicting events side-by-side in the warning notification (with their color indicators)?
> 2. For the calendar month view, can we visually highlight days with conflicts (e.g., amber border around the date)?
> 3. Is it possible to have different conflict severity levels (caution vs. alert) based on conflict type?
>
> I want to make sure my designs are realistic and implementable! Let me know what works best from a technical standpoint.
>
> Thanks!
> [Designer Name]

**From developer to designer:**

> Subject: RE: EventPro Conflict Detection Interface Question
>
> Hi [Designer Name],
>
> Great questions! Here's what's possible:
>
> 1. Yes, we can show both conflicting events side-by-side. The API returns both event IDs, names, and colors for each conflict.
> 2. Absolutely—we can add a CSS class to calendar days with conflicts, which you can style with borders, background colors, or icons.
> 3. Definitely possible. The conflict detection already categorizes by severity (venue overlap = high, vendor overlap = medium). We can map those to your color scheme.
>
> Attached is the conflict detection API response structure showing what data we can provide to your interface designs.
>
> Let me know if you need clarification on anything!
>
> Best,
> [Developer Name]

### Tone in Collaboration

- **Professional and supportive** (this is a serious professional tool)
- **Curious and collaborative** (both disciplines learning from each other)
- **Respectful of constraints** (designers respect technical limits, developers respect creative vision)
- **Problem-solving focused** (finding solutions together)
- **Event-industry aware** (understanding coordinator pain points drives both disciplines)

### When to Be More Formal

- Asset delivery deadlines
- Technical limitations that block design implementation
- Accessibility requirements
- Any safety or inclusion concerns (event coordinators work under high stress—design should support, not add pressure)
