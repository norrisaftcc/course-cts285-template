## The Five Things That Will Save You

### 1. Your Job Is Not To Write Code

Your job is to **ship a product**. Code is one tool. Communication, planning, and compromise are the others.

Teams fail on communication, not technical skill. Every. Single. Time.

---

### 2. The Collaboration Minimum (This Is Graded)

Every sprint, you must:

| Action | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Review 2+ pull requests | GitHub PR history |
| Ask for help at least once | Slack/Discord message |
| Offer help at least once | Slack/Discord message |
| Attend ceremonies | Meeting notes |
| Update your tasks daily | Project board movement |

**Document this.** Screenshot your PR reviews. Save messages. When peer evaluation happens, you need receipts.

---

### 3. Escalate Early (This Is Not Snitching)

If a teammate disappears for a week, **tell the instructor immediately.**

Why? Because:
- The instructor has resources you don't (accommodations, extensions, counseling referrals)
- You only have resentment
- The struggling person needs help, not cover

**Reframe:** Escalation is how help arrives. Silence is how problems compound.

---

### 4. Vertical Slices, Not Horizontal Layers

**WRONG:** "We spent 4 weeks on the database, then 4 weeks on the API, then ran out of time for the UI."

**RIGHT:** "Sprint 1: A user can register and see an empty dashboard. It's ugly but it works."

Build **one complete feature** before starting the next. A working ugly thing beats a beautiful unfinished thing.

**The test:** Can a human use it? If yes, it counts. If no, it doesn't—no matter how good the code is.

---

### 5. The Four Failure Archetypes (Recognize Early)

| Pattern | Behavior | Early Intervention |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **The Ghost** 👻 | Stops responding, misses meetings | Reach out 1-on-1 with concern, not accusation. Reduce their scope. Escalate after 1 week. |
| **The Hero** 🦸 | Does everything, rewrites others' code | Thank them, then set boundaries. "I need to do this myself to learn." |
| **The Critic** 🎭 | Finds problems, doesn't build solutions | "Good point—can you implement the alternative?" |
| **The Optimist** 🌈 | Everything's "almost done" (it's not) | Double their estimates. Check in more frequently. |

Everyone—including you—can fall into these under stress. Recognizing the pattern early allows intervention before crisis.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The survival guide is 6,500 words because there's a lot that can go wrong. But here's the core of it:

**Be responsive.** Answer messages within 24 hours.

**Be honest.** If you're stuck, say so. If you're overwhelmed, say so. If you're going to miss a deadline, say so BEFORE the deadline.

**Be kind.** Your teammates are stressed too. Assume good intent until proven otherwise.

Teams that do these three things usually succeed. Teams that don't, don't.
