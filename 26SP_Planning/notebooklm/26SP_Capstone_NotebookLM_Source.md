# Spring 2026 Capstone Project Orientation
## A Presentation by the Educational Division of AlgoCratic Futures™

**Document Purpose:** This source document is optimized for NotebookLM to generate presentations, audio overviews, and visual materials for the CSC 289 Programming Capstone orientation. It balances an immersive satirical corporate framing with genuine guidance about what determines success in team-based software development.

**Presentation Focus:** The central thesis is that *process and communication determine success*—not technical skill alone.

## SECTION 1: THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH ABOUT CAPSTONE SUCCESS

### The Real Reason Teams Fail

Research into capstone project outcomes reveals a consistent pattern: teams fail on communication, not technical skill. Every single time.

Technical problems have technical solutions. Communication problems compound exponentially until the project collapses.

This is why The Algorithm™ has optimized your semester for maximum collaboration infrastructure before a single line of production code is written.

### What "Success" Actually Means

Your job is not to write code. Your job is to **ship a product**. 

Code is one tool. Communication, planning, and compromise are the others.

The teams that succeed are the ones who understand this distinction from day one.

### The Hierarchy of Capstone Priorities

1. **Communication** — Can your team exchange information reliably?
2. **Process** — Does your team have shared workflows and expectations?
3. **Planning** — Does your team know what "done" looks like?
4. **Technical Execution** — Can your team build things?

Notice that technical execution is fourth. Not first. Fourth.

## SECTION 2: THE FOUR PLATFORM PROJECTS

### Overview: One Platform, Six Faces

Each development team builds a **platform**, not a product. Each platform powers six white-label applications—five genuine market applications plus one AlgoCratic Futures™ satirical variant.

This architecture teaches three critical industry skills:
- Building flexible, configurable systems
- Separating business logic from presentation
- Understanding how the same codebase serves different markets

### Platform 1: Task Management

**Core Technical Challenge:** Multi-tenant workspaces and permission hierarchies

**White-Label Applications:**
- FamilyHub (household coordination)
- StudyStream (student assignments)
- FreelanceFlow (contractor projects)
- EventPro (event planning)
- RenovateRight (home renovation)
- TeamFlow™ (AlgoCratic corporate surveillance... er, collaboration)

**Database Focus:** Role-based access control, task dependencies, audit logging

**Why This Matters:** Permission systems are everywhere in enterprise software. Learning to model "who can see what" is a career-defining skill.

### Platform 2: E-Commerce Storefront

**Core Technical Challenge:** Transaction integrity and inventory management

**White-Label Applications:**
- CandleGlow (artisan subscriptions)
- ThreadLine (fashion retail)
- TechDrop (electronics)
- PetPantry (pet supplies)
- GreenThumb (garden supplies)
- ComplianceCart™ (mandatory corporate procurement)

**Database Focus:** Order state machines, product variants, transaction rollbacks

**Why This Matters:** E-commerce is a trillion-dollar industry. Understanding how money moves through systems safely is fundamental.

### Platform 3: Recommendation Engine

**Core Technical Challenge:** Preference modeling and similarity algorithms

**White-Label Applications:**
- NextRead (book recommendations)
- TableFor (restaurant discovery)
- WheelMatch (vehicle comparison)
- StreamPick (entertainment)
- FlavorFind (recipe suggestions)
- PreferenceOptimizer™ (lifestyle alignment optimization)

**Database Focus:** User profiles, rating aggregation, collaborative filtering

**Why This Matters:** Recommendation systems power modern user experiences. Understanding how preferences translate to suggestions is increasingly valuable.

### Platform 4: Health & Wellness Tracker

**Core Technical Challenge:** Time-series data and privacy requirements

**White-Label Applications:**
- FitPath (fitness tracking)
- HeartWatch (biometric monitoring)
- PawHealth (pet health records)
- MindCalm (mental wellness)
- NutriLog (nutrition tracking)
- BiometricCompliance™ (mandatory corporate wellness)

**Database Focus:** Temporal queries, data retention policies, HIPAA awareness

**Why This Matters:** Healthcare data has unique constraints. Learning to handle sensitive time-series data prepares you for high-stakes domains.

---

## SECTION 3: THE COLLABORATION MINIMUM

### What Gets Measured Gets Done

The Algorithm™ tracks collaboration because collaboration determines outcomes. These are not suggestions—they are the minimum viable participation that demonstrates you are functioning as a team member.

### Required Actions Every Sprint

| Action | Evidence Required | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Review 2+ pull requests | GitHub PR history | You learn from others' code; they improve from your feedback |
| Ask for help at least once | Slack/Discord message | Admitting confusion prevents compounding mistakes |
| Offer help at least once | Slack/Discord message | Teaching solidifies your own understanding |
| Attend all ceremonies | Meeting notes | Presence enables coordination |
| Update tasks daily | Project board movement | Visibility prevents surprises |

### Documentation Is Required

Screenshot your PR reviews. Save messages. When peer evaluation happens, you need receipts.

"I helped but didn't document it" is indistinguishable from "I didn't help."

---

## SECTION 4: THE FIVE FAILURE ARCHETYPES

### Recognize These Patterns Early

Every team member—including you—can fall into these patterns under stress. Recognizing them early allows intervention before crisis.

### The Ghost 👻

**Behavior:** Stops responding, misses meetings, disappears for days

**Early Intervention:** 
- Reach out one-on-one with concern, not accusation
- Reduce their scope to something achievable
- Escalate to instructor after one week of unresponsiveness

**What's Actually Happening:** Usually overwhelmed, anxious, or dealing with external crises. They need help, not judgment.

### The Hero 🦸

**Behavior:** Does everything, rewrites others' code, can't delegate

**Early Intervention:**
- Thank them genuinely for their effort
- Set explicit boundaries: "I need to do this myself to learn"
- Redirect their energy to documentation or architecture

**What's Actually Happening:** Anxiety about quality, difficulty trusting others, sometimes ego. They mean well but create dependency.

### The Critic 🎭

**Behavior:** Identifies every problem, proposes no solutions, blocks progress

**Early Intervention:**
- Require solution proposals: "Good point—can you implement the alternative?"
- Redirect critical energy to code review
- Create explicit ownership: problems you find become problems you solve

**What's Actually Happening:** Often fear of failure manifesting as analysis paralysis. Making them responsible for fixes channels critique into action.

### The Optimist 🌈

**Behavior:** Everything is "almost done" (it's not), estimates are fantasies, reality denial

**Early Intervention:**
- Double their time estimates automatically
- Require working demos, not promises
- Check in more frequently with specific deliverable questions

**What's Actually Happening:** Difficulty estimating complexity, sometimes avoidance. Frequent verification catches drift early.

### The Universal Truth

Everyone exhibits these patterns sometimes. Self-awareness is your defense. If you notice yourself ghosting, hero-ing, critiquing without building, or promising without delivering—course correct.

---

## SECTION 5: VERTICAL SLICES, NOT HORIZONTAL LAYERS

### The Wrong Way

"We spent 4 weeks on the database, then 4 weeks on the API, then ran out of time for the UI."

This is how projects fail. You build impressive infrastructure that no one can see or use.

### The Right Way

"Sprint 1: A user can register and see an empty dashboard. It's ugly but it works."

Build **one complete feature** before starting the next.

### The Test

Can a human use it? 

If yes, it counts. If no, it doesn't—no matter how good the code is.

### Why This Matters

- **Proves integration works** before you're committed
- **Creates visible progress** that maintains team morale
- **Enables feedback** from design partners and users
- **Reduces risk** by failing small and early

A working ugly thing beats a beautiful unfinished thing every time.

## SECTION 6: ESCALATION IS NOT SNITCHING

### Reframe How You Think About This

If a teammate disappears for a week, tell the instructor immediately.

This feels wrong. It feels like betrayal. It isn't.

### Why You Must Escalate

**The instructor has resources you don't:**
- Accommodations for students with disabilities or crises
- Extensions for documented circumstances
- Connections to counseling and support services
- Authority to restructure team responsibilities

**You only have resentment.**

Covering for a struggling teammate doesn't help them—it enables the problem to compound until it's unsolvable.

### The Reframe

Escalation is how help arrives. Silence is how problems become catastrophes.

The person who escalates is not a snitch. They're the person who cared enough to get help when help was needed.

---

## SECTION 7: THE TEAM CONTRACT

### Required By End of Week 1

Every team must complete and submit a team contract. This is not optional. This is the foundation.

### What the Contract Covers

**Communication Expectations:**
- Primary channel (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- Expected response time (hint: 24 hours maximum)
- Standing meeting times

**Work Expectations:**
- Minimum hours per week per person
- How you handle missed deadlines
- How you handle unresponsive teammates

**Escalation Agreement:**
When does the instructor get involved? Define this explicitly:
- Teammate unresponsive for more than X days
- Same problem appears in 2+ retrospectives
- Interpersonal conflict affecting the work

**Collaboration Commitment:**
Every member commits to the Collaboration Minimum every sprint.

### Why This Matters

"We didn't think we'd need rules" is how teams discover they needed rules after the damage is done.

Writing it down before conflict arises creates a shared reference point when conflict arrives—and conflict always arrives.

---

## SECTION 8: YOUR FIRST TWO WEEKS

### Week 1 Deliverables (Non-Negotiable)

| Deliverable | Due | Evidence |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| Team contract signed | Day 5 | Submitted document |
| Communication channel created | Day 2 | Link shared |
| First standup completed | Day 3 | Meeting notes posted |
| First GitHub issue created | Day 5 | Issue link |
| Dev environment working | Day 5 | All members confirm |

### Week 2 Deliverables (Non-Negotiable)

| Deliverable | Due | Evidence |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| First PR merged | Day 10 | PR link (even if trivial) |
| Something deployed | Day 10 | URL or screenshot |
| Design partners contacted | Day 10 | Introduction message screenshot |

### The Philosophy

"We spent Week 1 on architecture" is how teams fail.

Interpersonal foundations first. Technical foundations second.

You can't design a database if you can't talk to each other.

---

## SECTION 9: INSTRUCTOR MEETING AVAILABILITY

### On Days We Don't Meet In Class

The same timeslot reserved for class is available for team meetings with your instructor.

This is not optional "office hours." This is structured support time.

### How To Use This Time

**Early Weeks (1-4):** Get your feet under you. Establish communication patterns. Ask basic questions without pressure.

**Middle Weeks (5-10):** Debug team dynamics. Address conflicts before they compound. Get feedback on architecture decisions.

**Late Weeks (11-16):** Crisis intervention if needed. Demo practice. Final push coordination.

### The Guarantee

If your team is struggling and you haven't used your instructor meeting time, you left help on the table.

---

## SECTION 10: THE THREE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY MATTER

### If You Remember Nothing Else

**Be responsive.** Answer messages within 24 hours. Always.

**Be honest.** If you're stuck, say so. If you're overwhelmed, say so. If you're going to miss a deadline, say so BEFORE the deadline.

**Be kind.** Your teammates are stressed too. Assume good intent until proven otherwise.

Teams that do these three things usually succeed. Teams that don't, don't.

---

## SECTION 11: THE ALGOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE

### Why The Satirical Framing?

The Algorithm™ isn't real. The challenges it represents are.

Every dystopian element in AlgoCratic Futures™ mirrors something you'll encounter in actual workplaces:

- **Surveillance metrics** → Performance reviews and productivity tracking
- **Contradictory requirements** → Changing stakeholder priorities
- **Cheerful coercion** → Corporate culture expectations
- **Impossible deadlines** → Aggressive sprint planning

By experiencing these absurdities in an exaggerated, humorous context, you develop pattern recognition for when they appear in subtler forms.

### The Educational Purpose

This isn't a joke. This is inoculation.

When you encounter a real manager who cheerfully announces impossible deadlines, you'll recognize the pattern. You'll have language for it. You'll know how to navigate it.

The Algorithm™ teaches through satire what experience teaches through suffering.

## NOTEBOOKLM GENERATION GUIDANCE

### For Slide Deck Generation

**Suggested Prompt:** "Create a presentation for college students starting their capstone project. Focus on why communication and process matter more than technical skill. Include the failure archetypes, the collaboration minimum, and the week 1-2 deliverables. Use a professional but slightly humorous corporate tone."

**Key Sections for Slides:**
1. The Uncomfortable Truth (teams fail on communication)
2. The Four Platforms (brief overview)
3. The Collaboration Minimum (the table)
4. The Five Failure Archetypes (one slide each)
5. Vertical Slices vs. Horizontal Layers
6. Week 1-2 Deliverables
7. The Three Things That Actually Matter

### For Audio Overview Generation

**Suggested Prompt:** "Create an engaging audio discussion about why capstone projects succeed or fail. Two hosts should debate the importance of process versus technical skill, eventually concluding that communication is the deciding factor. Include real examples from the failure archetypes."

### For Infographic Generation

**Suggested Prompt:** "Create an infographic showing the hierarchy of capstone success factors: Communication → Process → Planning → Technical Execution. Include the collaboration minimum checklist and the first two weeks of deliverables."
