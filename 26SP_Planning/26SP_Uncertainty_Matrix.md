# Spring 2026 Uncertainty Matrix
## Tracking Open Questions & Pending Decisions

**Document Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT  
**Clearance Level:** GRAY (Instructional Planning)  
**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Purpose

This document tracks:
- Questions we don't have answers to yet
- Decisions that need to be made (and by whom)
- Assumptions we're making that might be wrong
- Dependencies on external factors

**Philosophy:** Acknowledging uncertainty is better than pretending we know things we don't.

## Critical Unknowns (Must Resolve Before Semester)

### Staffing & Enrollment

| Question | Impact if Unresolved | Owner | Target Date |
|----------|---------------------|-------|-------------|
| Final enrollment numbers for CSC 289? | Can't finalize team sizes | Registrar/Dept | Late Jan |
| How many DB capstone students available? | Affects team composition | Dept | Late Jan |
| Design group sizes confirmed? | Affects pairing model | GRD Lead | Late Jan |
| What if we have 5 teams but 4 DB students? | Need contingency plan | CSC Lead | Before Week 1 |

### Platform Assignment

| Question | Impact if Unresolved | Owner | Target Date |
|----------|---------------------|-------|-------------|
| How are teams assigned to platforms? | Student buy-in, workload balance | CSC Lead | Week 1 |
| Can students express preferences? | Motivation, but complexity | CSC Lead | Week 1 |
| What if everyone wants the same platform? | Need tiebreaker | CSC Lead | Week 1 |

## Important Unknowns (Resolve Early in Semester)

### Evaluation & Grading

| Question | Current Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Owner |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| How is collaboration graded? | Peer review informs but doesn't determine grades | Students game peer review OR ignore collaboration | Both Leads |
| Who grades the themed implementation? | CSC grades technical, GRD acknowledges but doesn't grade | Unclear expectations | Both Leads |
| What % is collaboration worth? | 10-15% of grade | Too low = ignored; too high = unfair | Both Leads |
| How do we handle cross-group peer review? | Informational feedback | Could create friction | Both Leads |
| Does DB student get separate grade from team? | Yes, for DB-specific deliverables | Unclear role boundaries | CSC Lead |

### Clearance System

| Question | Current Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Owner |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| What are YELLOW exit tickets? | TBD, define during semester | Students unclear on progression | CSC Lead |
| What are GREEN exit tickets? | TBD, define during semester | Same | CSC Lead |
| Does DB specialist reach GREEN? | Probably YELLOW max | Unclear expectations | CSC Lead |
| How does GRAY (design) interact with color system? | Parallel track, occasional crossover | Confusion about status | Both Leads |

### Technical

| Question | Current Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Owner |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Required tech stack for all teams? | Flexible within guardrails | Inconsistent support burden | CSC Lead |
| Deployment requirements? | Local demo acceptable, cloud preferred | Scope creep or underwhelm | CSC Lead |
| Shared infrastructure (DB hosting, etc.)? | Teams manage own | Could simplify OR complicate | CSC Lead |

---

## Lower Priority Unknowns (Can Resolve During Semester)

### Cross-Discipline Logistics

| Question | Impact | When Needed |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Shared communication platform? | Coordination friction | Week 1-2 |
| Joint meeting scheduling logistics? | Calendar conflicts | Week 1-2 |
| What if design student doesn't deliver assets? | Dev can't implement theme | Week 8 |
| What if dev team can't implement ANY theme? | Design student loses portfolio piece | Week 10 |

### AlgoCratic Integration

| Question | Impact | When Needed |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How much satire in CSC 289 vs CTS 285? | Tone consistency | Week 1 |
| Do DB specialists get full AlgoCratic onboarding? | Cultural integration | Week 1-2 |
| Are satirical white-labels required or optional? | Scope for design students | Week 2 |
| Joint satirical elements (shared jokes, etc.)? | Fun but not critical | Ongoing |

### Portfolio & Career

| Question | Impact | When Needed |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Can students use white-label work in portfolios? | Legal/ethical clarity | Before finals |
| How do we help frame capstone for job searches? | Career outcomes | Week 14-16 |
| LinkedIn/resume guidance for team projects? | Career outcomes | Week 14-16 |

## Assumptions We're Making

### About Students

| Assumption | Confidence | What Changes if Wrong |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| CTS 285 grads are ORANGE-competent | HIGH | Need remediation track |
| DB students have SQL fundamentals | MEDIUM | Need accelerated bootcamp |
| Students will communicate proactively | LOW | Need more structure |
| Teams will self-organize effectively | MEDIUM | Need more checkpoints |

### About Collaboration

| Assumption | Confidence | What Changes if Wrong |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Design students will deliver usable assets | MEDIUM | Need fallback brand kits |
| Dev teams can implement theming | HIGH | Reduce requirement |
| Weekly touchpoints are sufficient | MEDIUM | May need more structure |
| Peer review will be constructive | MEDIUM | Need moderation |

### About Scope

| Assumption | Confidence | What Changes if Wrong |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| 16 weeks is enough for MVP | HIGH | Reduce scope early |
| All four platforms are parallel difficulty | MEDIUM | May need to rebalance |
| One DB specialist per team is sufficient | MEDIUM | May need float support |
| Design 8-week timeline aligns with dev needs | MEDIUM | Adjust handoff timing |

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | What We Need | Risk if Unavailable |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| GitHub Education | Organization, Classroom | Use personal accounts (messy) |
| Cloud hosting (Render, Railway, etc.) | Deployment platform | Local-only demos |
| Design software access | Students' Figma/Adobe | Quality of deliverables |

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | What We Need | Risk if Unavailable |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| GRD instructor availability | Coordination meetings | Siloed development |
| DB curriculum alignment | ORM/SQL coverage | DB students underprepared |
| CTS 285 fall outcomes | ORANGE-competent students | Need to adjust Week 1 |

## Decision Log

*Record decisions as they're made to reduce re-discussion*

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Decided By |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Dec 2024 | Four platforms (Task, E-Commerce, Rec Engine, Health) | Parallel complexity, distinct DB challenges | CSC/GRD Planning |
| Dec 2024 | 6 white-labels per platform (5 real + 1 satirical) | Provides variety, maintains AlgoCratic integration | CSC/GRD Planning |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Questions for GRD Lead

*Specific questions for the next planning sync*

1. **Design deliverable format**: Is there a standard format/template for brand asset delivery that your students use?

2. **Design timeline flexibility**: Week 8 handoff is based on your 8-week project. Is that accurate? Any flexibility?

3. **White-label assignment**: Do individual designers choose which white-label to brand, or are they assigned?

4. **Satirical comfort**: Are all design students comfortable with the AlgoCratic satirical elements? Should we make the satirical white-label optional?

5. **Physical products**: The briefs mention physical product tie-ins. Is that part of design scope, or just conceptual?

6. **Portfolio rights**: Any concerns about students using collaborative work in portfolios?

---

## Questions for Department/Administration

*May need answers before semester*

1. **Cross-listed assessment**: How do we handle grading when work spans two courses?

2. **Collaboration documentation**: Do we need formal documentation of the cross-course collaboration?

3. **Industry mentor involvement**: Is there budget/support for bringing in external reviewers?

4. **Showcase event**: Can we coordinate a joint end-of-semester showcase?
