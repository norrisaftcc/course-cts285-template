# task management platform capstone fragment

Ecommerce Storefront 

    I can white label just about anything for this:

    Candles/Lotions

    Clothing Label/Brand

    Tech products - etc

Recommendation Engine

    Books/Movies

    Restaurant/Dinning

    Would comparison shopping fall under this? Like for shopping for cars, or comparing grocery prices?

Biometrics Tracker

    Fitness Tracker (exercise/weight loss) 

    Health Tracker (like heart rate, blood pressure etc for health conditions or age)

    Pet Health Tracker

Calendar/Planning/Task Management

    For students: Assignments / Extracurricular Activities / Etc

    For families: shared access to managing appointments/activities/travel/school dates etc

    For Organizations (the Coffee Shop my student presented on needed something like this for all their community events)?

 

Claude helped clarify this idea for me a bit, but it kind of split into 2 categories:

"Wellness & Mental Health Tools" captures:

    Mood tracking and journaling
    Meditation/breathing exercise timers
    Anxiety/stress management features
    Gratitude journals and daily affirmations
    Habit tracking for mental health routines
    Crisis resource directories

"Cognitive Support Tools" is more specific to neurodivergency and includes:

    Focus timers (Pomodoro, time-blocking)
    Task breakdown and executive function aids
    Sensory regulation tools (calming sounds, visual stimmers)
    Memory aids and reminder systems
    Routine builders with visual schedules
    Social script helpers
