## INSTRUCTOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Week 1 Priorities
1. Set up GitHub Organization: `algocratic-futures-[semester]`
2. Create GitHub Classroom for assignment distribution
3. Prepare physical clearance badges and lanyards
4. Set up Discord/Slack with clearance-based channels
5. Create "The Algorithm" prop (old computer or device)

### Maintaining Immersion
- **In-character** for all assignment descriptions and announcements
- **Out-of-character** for actual technical help and feedback
- **Underground style** for student-facing troubleshooting guides
- **Professional** for rubrics and learning objectives

### Balance Points
- Satire should be ~5% of course experience
- 95% should be genuine skill development
- Break character for serious student concerns
- Use humor to reduce anxiety, not create it

### Support Structures
- Office hours as "Algorithmic Guidance Sessions"
- TA help as "Higher Clearance Consultation"
- Peer tutoring as "Citizen Mentorship Program"
- "Underground" guides for debugging common issues
