## NARRATIVE ARC

### Act 1: The Innocent (INFRARED)
*"Welcome to AlgoCratic Futures™! Everything is fine. The Algorithm is benevolent."*

Students are introduced to the corporate dystopia gently. Requirements are mostly straightforward. The absurdity is present but not overwhelming.

### Act 2: The Reality (RED)
*"The Algorithm has expectations. Collaboration is mandatory. Failure is... documented."*

Contradictions emerge. Git conflicts happen. The satirical elements intensify. Students begin to understand the metaphor while building real skills.

### Act 3: The Enhancement (ORANGE)
*"You now have access to advanced tools. The Algorithm watches. The Algorithm learns."*

AI tools are introduced as "dangerous" powers. Students gain autonomy while learning to question the outputs. The satire serves the learning.

### Act 4: The Crisis (YELLOW)
*"Production is failing. Users are complaining. Fix it. Now."*

Real-world pressure simulation. Deadlines matter. Performance counts. Students develop professional resilience through managed stress.

### Act 5: The Graduation (GREEN)
*"You have proven yourself. Share your knowledge. Lead others. The Algorithm is... proud?"*

Students emerge as competent developers ready for the next level. The satire has served its purpose. They're ready for real work or CSC 289.

3. **Modified timeline** if needed (focus on core skills)
4. **Peer mentorship** assignment
5. **Additional office hours**

### If Assignment Too Hard
1. **Gather feedback** during assignment
2. **Provide supplementary resources** immediately

4. **Post-mortem** after completion
5. **Adjust future assignments** accordingly

### If Engagement Drops
1. **Quick survey** to identify issues
2. **Adjust narrative elements** if satire isn't landing
3. **Smaller project scope** if workload overwhelming
4. **More frequent checkpoints**
5. **Return to core purpose**: skill building, not entertainment
