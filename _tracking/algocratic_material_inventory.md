## Gap Analysis by Course

### CTS 285 Gaps (What Needs Creation)

#### INFRARED (Weeks 1-2) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Environment Setup Protocol assignment
- [ ] Calculator v1.0 assignment (Python basics)
- [ ] Calculator v2.0 assignment (functions, iteration)
- [ ] "Welcome to AlgoCratic" reading/onboarding

#### RED (Weeks 3-6) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] MindMeld™ Git collaboration exercise
- [ ] Debugging scenario collection
- [ ] Datamon console game project spec
- [ ] Code review rubric and process

#### ORANGE (Weeks 7-10) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [x] Marketing Sprint ✅ EXISTS
- [x] HiLow Game PRD ✅ EXISTS (needs template conversion)
- [ ] Flask tutorial sequence
- [ ] Product web app project spec

#### YELLOW (Weeks 11-14) - LOWER PRIORITY
- [ ] Crisis management scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization challenges
- [ ] API integration exercises

#### GREEN (Weeks 15-16) - LOWER PRIORITY
- [ ] Portfolio documentation template
- [ ] Presentation rubric
- [ ] Final project spec

### CSC 289 Gaps (What Needs Creation)

#### Module Structure - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Team contract template (Day 1 Essentials has draft but needs polish)
- [ ] Platform brief templates (one per platform)
- [ ] Sprint ceremony guides
- [ ] Living document templates (design brief, architecture doc, etc.)

#### Rubrics - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Sprint review rubric
- [ ] Peer evaluation rubric
- [ ] Portfolio assessment rubric
- [ ] Cross-functional collaboration rubric

#### Assignments by Sprint - MEDIUM PRIORITY
Since CSC 289 is team-based capstone, "assignments" are different:
- [ ] Sprint 1 deliverables checklist
- [ ] Sprint 2-6 increment expectations
- [ ] Design handoff checkpoint (Week 8)
- [ ] Final demo requirements

#### Platform-Specific Content - LOWER PRIORITY (can develop during semester)
- [ ] Task Management technical guidance
- [ ] E-Commerce technical guidance  
- [ ] Recommendation Engine technical guidance
- [ ] Health Tracker technical guidance

## Manifest Structure Recommendations

### For CTS 285 (`course-manifest-cts285.yaml`)

```yaml
# Structure mirrors CSC 134 pattern
modules:
  - id: M01
    name: "The Onboarding"
    weeks: [1, 2]
    clearance: INFRARED
    deliverables:
      - type: reading/tutorial/lab/project/rubric
      # etc.
```

**Clearances as metadata, not modules.** Modules are calendar-based (8 modules = 16 weeks).

### For CSC 289 (`course-manifest-csc289.yaml`)

```yaml
# Different structure needed for team-based capstone
modules:
  - id: M01
    name: "Level Setting & Team Formation"
    weeks: [1, 2]
    clearance_entry: ORANGE
    
    # Living documents that persist across sprints
    living_documents:
      - name: "Team Contract"
        file: "teams/{team}/team-contract.md"
        status: created_m01_updated_ongoing
        
      - name: "Platform Brief"
        file: "teams/{team}/platform-brief.md"
        status: instructor_provided
        
    # Sprint-specific deliverables
    sprint_deliverables:
      - name: "Sprint 0 Planning"
        type: ceremony
        
    # Course-wide deliverables
    deliverables:
      - type: reading
        name: "Day 1 Essentials"
        file: "docs/DAY_1_ESSENTIALS.md"
        status: complete
```

**Key differences:**
1. `living_documents` vs one-time `deliverables`
2. Team-scoped vs individual-scoped
3. Sprint cadence vs module cadence
4. Platform variants (may need `platforms` top-level key)

---

## The Four CSC 289 Platforms

Each platform produces 6 white-label applications. From `26SP_Platform_Project_Matrix.md`:

| Platform | White-Labels | AlgoCratic Variant | DB Focus |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Task Management | FamilyHub, StudyStream, FreelanceFlow, EventPro, RenovateRight | TeamFlow™ | RBAC, hierarchies |
| E-Commerce | CandleGlow, ThreadLine, TechDrop, PetPantry, GreenThumb | ComplianceCart™ | Transactions, state machines |
| Recommendation | NextRead, TableFor, WheelMatch, StreamPick, FlavorFind | PreferenceOptimizer™ | Graph data, ratings |
| Health Tracker | FitPath, HeartWatch, PawHealth, MindCalm, NutriLog | BiometricCompliance™ | Time-series, privacy |

**Manifest implication:** May need platform selection as top-level config, or conditional module content.

## Priority Matrix for Content Development

### Tier 1: Blocks CTS 285 Launch (Immediate)
1. M01-M02 INFRARED assignments (setup, calculators)
2. M03 RED assignments (MindMeld™, debugging)
3. Course-wide rubrics
4. CTS 285 manifest itself

### Tier 2: Needed Before CSC 289 Launch
1. CSC 289 manifest structure design
2. Team contract finalization
3. Platform brief templates
4. Sprint ceremony guides
5. Peer evaluation rubric

### Tier 3: Can Develop During Semester
1. CTS 285 YELLOW/GREEN content
2. CSC 289 platform-specific guides
3. Advanced satirical content
4. Cross-functional polish

## Open Questions for Manifest Design

### CTS 285
1. **Datamon scope?** Is it a 1-week or 2-week project? Console only or GUI?
2. **HiLow conversion:** Keep as-is or create GitHub Classroom template?
3. **Assessment weighting:** How do assignments map to final grade?

### CSC 289
1. **Team tracking:** One manifest or four (per platform)?
2. **Living documents:** How to track status of continuously-updated docs?
3. **Sprints vs modules:** Are sprints 2-week or flexible?
4. **DB student catch-up:** Separate track in M01-M02 or integrated?
5. **Design handoff:** How formally tracked?

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review this inventory** - Confirm/correct any misclassifications
2. **Answer open questions** - Especially around CSC 289 structure
3. **Create CTS 285 manifest** - Using CSC 134 as template, start with what exists
4. **Prototype CSC 289 manifest** - Test structure against platform/team complexity
5. **Build tracking tool** - Once manifests exist and structure is validated
